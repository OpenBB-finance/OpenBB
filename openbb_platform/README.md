# OpenBB Platform

The OpenBB Platform is a set of Python packages that turn financial and economic data sources into one typed Python client (`from openbb import obb`), a FastAPI REST API, and an MCP server.

`openbb-core` is the runtime. It ships no data and no commands; it discovers the extensions installed in the environment through entry points and assembles them. Everything else in this folder is an extension:

- **Routers** add command namespaces such as `obb.equity` or `obb.economy`.
- **Providers** implement those commands against a data source, and may add their own namespace such as `obb.fred`.
- **OBBject extensions** add accessors to every result, such as `result.charting`.

Documentation lives at [docs.openbb.co](https://docs.openbb.co).

### OBBject extensions

| Package | Accessor |
|---------|----------|
| `openbb-charting` | `result.charting`: Plotly charts, with native window rendering through the `pywry` extra. |

## Installation

Install `openbb-core` together with the routers and providers you need; `openbb-core` is pulled in by each of them.

```bash
pip install openbb-equity openbb-cboe
```

The `openbb` Python package is generated from whatever is installed. It rebuilds on import when the installed extensions change, and `openbb-build` rebuilds it explicitly after installing or removing an extension.

```bash
openbb-build
```

## Python

```python
from openbb import obb

output = obb.equity.price.historical("AAPL", provider="cboe")
df = output.to_dataframe()
```

## Credentials

Providers that need a key read it as `<provider>_<credential>`, as listed in the provider table.

Set keys in `~/.openbb_platform/user_settings.json`:

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "fred_api_key": "REPLACE_ME",
    "bls_api_key": "REPLACE_ME"
  }
}
```

Or as environment variables, which take precedence over the file. `~/.openbb_platform/.env` is loaded automatically.

```bash
export FRED_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME
```

Or for the current session only:

```python
from openbb import obb

obb.user.credentials.fred_api_key = "REPLACE_ME"
```

## REST API

`openbb-platform-api` serves every installed command over FastAPI, with OpenAPI docs at `/docs` and a `widgets.json` for OpenBB Workspace.

```bash
pip install openbb-platform-api
openbb-api
```

The bare FastAPI app is `openbb_core.api.rest_api:app` and runs under any ASGI server.

```bash
uvicorn openbb_core.api.rest_api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

## MCP server

```bash
pip install openbb-mcp-server
openbb-mcp
```

See [extensions/mcp_server/README.md](extensions/mcp_server/README.md) for transports, tool discovery, and configuration.

## Local development

Requirements:

- Git
- Python 3.10 or newer
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

From an activated virtual environment at the repository root:

```bash
python openbb_platform/dev_install.py --routers
```

This installs every tracked package under `core`, `extensions`, `obbject_extensions`, `providers`, and `../cli` in editable mode, with all optional extras and each package's `dev` dependency group, then runs `openbb-build`. A new extension is picked up once its `pyproject.toml` is committed in one of those folders.

Router extensions (`openbb-equity`, `openbb-economy`, `openbb-fixedincome`, and the rest of the router table except `openbb-news`) are installed only with `--routers`. Without it, you get core, the tooling, `openbb-news`, the providers, `openbb-charting`, and the CLI.

Install the git hooks, which run the same ruff, ty, codespell, and markdownlint checks as CI:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Each package is linted and tested from its own directory, matching its CI workflow:

```bash
cd openbb_platform/providers/fred
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
ty check openbb_fred
pytest tests
```
