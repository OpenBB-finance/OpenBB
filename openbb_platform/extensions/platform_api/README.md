# OpenBB Platform API Meta Package

This is a meta package for installing a command line script to launch the OpenBB Platform API, and the OpenBB Terminal Pro data connector widgets build script.

## Installation

Install this package within an existing [OpenBB Platform Python environment](https://docs.openbb.co/platform/installation).

```sh
pip install openbb-platform-api
```

## Usage

The script is run from the command line, with the environment active, by entering:

```sh
openbb-api
```

This will launch a Fast API instance, via `uvicorn`, at `http://127.0.0.1:6900`

### Keyword Arguments

The behavior of the script can be configured with the use of arguments and keyword arguments.

Launcher specific arguments:

    --build                         Build the widgets.json file.
    --no-build                      Do not build the widgets.json file.
    --login                         Login to the OpenBB Platform.
    --no-filter                     Do not filter the widgets.json file.


All other arguments will be passed to uvicorn. Here are the most common ones:

    --host TEXT                     Host IP address or hostname.
                                      [default: 127.0.0.1]
    --port INTEGER                  Port number.
                                      [default: 6900]
    --ssl-keyfile TEXT              SSL key file.
    --ssl-certfile TEXT             SSL certificate file.
    --ssl-keyfile-password TEXT     SSL keyfile password.
    --ssl-version INTEGER           SSL version to use.
                                      (see stdlib ssl module's)
                                      [default: 17]
    --ssl-cert-reqs INTEGER         Whether client certificate is required.
                                      (see stdlib ssl module's)
                                      [default: 0]
    --ssl-ca-certs TEXT             CA certificates file.
    --ssl-ciphers TEXT              Ciphers to use.
                                      (see stdlib ssl module's)
                                      [default: TLSv1]

Run `uvicorn --help` to get the full list of arguments.

### API Over HTTPS

To run the API over the HTTPS protocol, you must first create a self-signed certificate and the associated key. After activating the environment, you can generate the files by entering this to the command line:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -days 3650 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key   -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256   -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```

Two files will be created, in the current working directory, that are passed as keyword arguments to the `openbb-api` entry point.

```sh
openbb-api --ssl_keyfile localhost.key --ssl_certfile localhost.crt
```

**Note**: Adjust the command to include the full path to the file if the current working directory is not where they are located.

The certificate - `localhost.crt` - will need to be added to system's trust store. The process for this will depend on the operating system and the user account privilege.

A quick solution is to visit the server's URL, show the details of the warning, and choose to continue anyways.

Contact the system administrator if you are using a work device and require additional permissions to complete the configuration.

### Location of `widgets.json`

An OpenBB Terminal Pro data connector requires a file, `widgets.json`, to be served by the API. It contains the configuration for each widget available to be added to a dashboard. The file is stored, and served from, the environment's assets folder.

```sh
/Path/to/environments/envs/obb/assets/widgets.json
```

It can be manually edited and served without the build process by passing `--no-build` to the API launch script.

```sh
openbb-api --no-build
```

If you would like to construct this file manually for a custom backend configuration, save the file in the path above.


### Location of `templates.json`

> ~/OpenBBUserData/workspace_templates.json

The OpenBB Workspace allows you to export the current dashboard layout - when it is a custom backend - as a template.

To export the layout, right-click on the dashboard and select, "Export Template".

A JSON dictionary will be exported. Insert the contents of the export into "~/OpenBBUserData/workspace_templates.json" by pasting between the JSON list markers, [ ].

If there is more than one, add a comma to the closing curly brace, }.
