"""BLS Router.

Thin assembly point that mounts one sub-router per survey topic. Each topic
lives in its own module under ``openbb_bls.routers`` so that the routes,
file-viewer choices/download endpoints, and chart packages for a survey are
co-located. Sub-routers are merged with no path prefix, so the public
``/bls/<command>`` routes are unchanged.
