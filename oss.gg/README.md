# Instructions for oss.gg Hacktoberfest 2024 Open Source Contributors

## Overview of OpenBB Quests

At oss.gg Hacktoberfest 2024, we have three types of contributions:

1. **GitHub Issues tagged with `🕹️ oss.gg`** (direct code contributions to this repository)
2. **Code Side-Quests** (tasks that involve coding but contribute to separate repositories or projects)
3. **No-Code Side-Quests** (non-coding tasks, such as writing tutorials, social media posts, etc.)

Each type of contribution has its own process, which we’ll describe below.

---

## How to Submit Code Contributions to this repository (GitHub Issues)

1. Choose an issue from the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/OpenBB-Finance/OpenBB/issues). The issue should have a `🕹️ oss.gg` label.
2. Comment with the `/assign` command to assign yourself.
3. Open a PR within 48 hours where you reference your issue. The PR should point to the `develop` branch.
4. The project maintainer will review the PR, and once it’s merged, you’ll be awarded your points automatically.

## How to Submit Code and No-Code Side-Quests

In the root of the repository, you’ll find a folder called `oss.gg`. Inside this folder, there are two subfolders:

1. **`code_side_quests`**: This folder contains `.md` files for each Code Side-Quest.
2. **`no_code_side_quests`**: This folder contains `.md` files for each No-Code Side-Quest.

For both types of side-quests, you will need to:

- Open the relevant `.md` file for your side quest.
- Click the edit file button (little pencil icon in top right)
- Add a new entry with the following information:
  - Your GitHub name
  - A UTC timestamp
  - A link to your proof of contribution (e.g., a fork or a new repository for code side-quests, or a blog post for no-code side-quests).
- Click the green commit changes button
- Add a commit message such as "Submitting No Code Side Quest"
- Make a helpful branch name such as feature/oss-gg-new-side-quest
- After committing - navigate to the main OpenBB repo and submit a pull request.

## How to Submit Code Side-Quests

1. Open an issue for your contribution. Use the oss.gg hack submission template.
2. Comment with the `/assign` command to assign yourself.
3. Add your details to the relevant `.md` file in the `code_side_quests` folder (as described above).
4. Open a PR where you reference your issue. The PR should point to the `develop` branch.
5. The project maintainer will review the submission, update the side quest log, and once the PR is merged, points will be awarded.

Note: Code Side-Quests often involve work in other repositories (forks or new projects) and do not contribute code directly to this repository.

## How to Submit No-Code Side-Quests

1. Open an issue for your contribution. Use the oss.gg hack submission template.
2. Comment with the `/assign` command to assign yourself.
3. Add your details to the relevant `.md` file in the `no_code_side_quests` folder (as described above).
4. Open a PR where you reference your issue. The PR should point to the `develop` branch.
5. The project maintainer will review the submission, update the side quest log, and once the PR is merged, points will be awarded.
