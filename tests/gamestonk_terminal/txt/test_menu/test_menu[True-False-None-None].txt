Welcome to Gamestonk Terminal Beta


Multiple jobs queue (where each '/' denotes a new command).
    E.g. '/stocks $ disc/ugs -n 3/../load tsla/candle'

If you want to jump from crypto/ta to stocks you can use an absolute path that starts with a slash (/).
    E.g. '/crypto/ta $ /stocks'

The previous logic also holds for when launching the terminal.
    E.g. '$ python terminal.py /stocks/disc/ugs -n 3/../load tsla/candle'

The main commands you should be aware when navigating through the terminal are:
    cls             clear the screen
    help / h / ?    help menu
    quit / q / ..   quit this menu and go one menu above
    exit            exit the terminal
    reset / r       reset the terminal and reload configs from the current location
    resources       only available on main contexts (not sub-menus)
