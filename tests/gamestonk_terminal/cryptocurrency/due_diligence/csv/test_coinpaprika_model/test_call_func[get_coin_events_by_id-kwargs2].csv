00:00:00",,"Eth 2.0 and ""what will happen to your ETH""","Can we get a sticky regarding this
topic? It'd clear up the daily convo on
this sub a great deal.  **What is ETH
2.0?:**  A series of upgrades to the
Ethereum network explained
[here](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/).
**Do I have to do anything?:**  No. This
is an update to the network itself,
Ether held in your wallet or on an
exchange or anywhere else is still the
same after the merge.  **What will
happen to the price?:**  Who knows.
**When will it be released?:**  At some
point in the future. ETH2 is series of
features/fixes with separate development
work and release dates. PoS itself might
see an accelerated release this year but
there are no guarantees. You can follow
the Ethereum dev teams work if you wish
to keep closer tabs.   **Answers to all
of these questions can be found on the
[ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/)
site.**  * [Staking](https://ethereum.or
