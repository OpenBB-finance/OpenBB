The API wraps the functionality of the terminal in a way that the python commands follow the same convention as the terminal.\nFor example stocks/load aapl becomes openbb.stocks.load(\u0026quot;aapl\u0026quot;).\n Python environment setup    Import the GST API into your python script or notebook with\nfrom openbb_terminal import api as openbb Understanding the API functions    To understand the parameters of an API function the simplest way is to refer to the docstring. Docstrings can be viewed using the code introspection tools of your text/notebook editor or the built-in python help command. Docstrings contain both the description of the functionality and the overview of the parameters.\nAs an example this is the docstring of openbb.economy.bigmac:\nDisplay Big Mac Index for given countries Parameters ---------- country_codes : List[str] List of country codes to get for raw : bool, optional Flag to display raw data, by default False export : str, optional Format data, by default \u0026#34;\u0026#34; external_axes : Optional[List[plt.Axes]], optional External axes (3 axes are expected in the list), by default None Usage examples    Load stock data into a dataframe:\naapl_data = openbb.stocks.load( ticker=\u0026#34;aapl\u0026#34;, start=\u0026#34;2021-06-10\u0026#34;, ) aapl_data = openbb.stocks.process_candle(aapl_data) Plot candle chart\nopenbb.stocks.candle(\u0026#34;AAPL\u0026#34;, aapl_data, True) Call the \u0026ldquo;What if\u0026rdquo; command of the backtesting menu\nopenbb.stocks.bt.whatif(\u0026#34;aapl\u0026#34;, 10, datetime.strptime(\u0026#34;2012-03-03\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;%Y-%m-%d\u0026#34;)) Get sentiment for a list of tickers\nopenbb.stocks.ca.models.finbrain.get_sentiments(tickers=[\u0026#34;aapl\u0026#34;]) Print key fundamental metrics for past 2 years\nopenbb.stocks.fa.fmp.metrics(ticker=\u0026#34;AAPL\u0026#34;, number=2) Get fundamental metrics for past 3 years as a pandas dataframe\nopenbb.stocks.fa.fmp.models.fmp.get_key_metrics(ticker=\u0026#34;AAPL\u0026#34;, number=3) Perform an OLS regression on multiple custom datasets\nopenbb.econometrics.ols( regression_variables=[ \u0026#39;close-tsla\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;volume-aapl\u0026#39; ], data={\u0026#34;aapl\u0026#34;:aapl_data,\u0026#34;tsla\u0026#34;:tsla_data}, datasets={ \u0026#34;close-tsla\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;Close\u0026#34;: None, \u0026#34;tsla\u0026#34;: None}, \u0026#34;volume-aapl\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;Volume\u0026#34;: None, \u0026#34;aapl\u0026#34;: None} } ) External matplotlib axes support    Most of the functions of the terminal that generate matplotlib charts support passing external axes into them.

The Keltner channel uses the average true range (ATR) or volatility, with breaks above or below the top and bottom barriers signaling a continuation. The channels are typically set two Average True Range values above and below the 20-day EMA. The exponential moving average dictates direction and the Average True Range sets channel width. Keltner Channels are a trend following indicator used to identify reversals with channel breakouts and channel direction. Channels can also be used to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is flat.\nIn his 1960 book, How to Make Money in Commodities, Chester Keltner introduced the “Ten-Day Moving Average Trading Rule,” which is credited as the original version of Keltner Channels. This original version started with a 10-day SMA of the typical price {(H+L+C)/3)} as the centerline. The 10-day SMA of the High-Low range was added and subtracted to set the upper and lower channel lines. Linda Bradford Raschke introduced the newer version of Keltner Channels in the 1980s. Like Bollinger Bands, this new version used a volatility based indicator, Average True Range (ATR), to set channel width. StockCharts.com uses this newer version of Keltner Channels.\nMiddle Line: 20-day exponential moving average Upper Channel Line: 20-day EMA + (2 x ATR(10)) Lower Channel Line: 20-day EMA - (2 x ATR(10)) /ta-vlt kc ticker: TSLA interval: 60 ma_mode: ema past_days: 180 extended_hours: true heikin_candles: true "},{"id":106,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/bots/discord/ta/ma/","title":"Ma","parent":"Ta","content":"ta-ma - Moving Averages\n/ta-ma ticker: DDS interval: 60 ma_mode: ema past_days: 365 window: 21,126,252 "},{"id":107,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/bots/discord/ta/macd/","title":"Macd","parent":"Ta","content":"ta-mom macd - Moving Average Convergence/Divergence Oscillator\nDeveloped by Gerald Appel in the late seventies, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence oscillator (MACD) is one of the simplest and most effective momentum indicators available.

As a result, the MACD offers the best of both worlds: trend following and momentum. The MACD fluctuates above and below the zero line as the moving averages converge, cross and diverge. Traders can look for signal line crossovers, centerline crossovers and divergences to generate signals.

Like skewness, kurtosis describes the shape of a probability distribution and there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Different measures of kurtosis may have different interpretations.\nFor research on this topic, visit: https://www.styleadvisor.com/resources/statfacts/kurtosis\nKurtosis identifies where the volatility risk came from in a distribution of returns. Kurtosis improves one’s understanding of volatility risk.\nKurtosis is also known as the fourth moment of the distribution, used in conjunction with mean, standard deviation, and skewness to understand the shape of a distribution of returns. In its base case, kurtosis has a neutral value of 3.0. The calculation is frequently modified by the second term in the equation below, which scales kurtosis so that the baseline, neutral value is 0.0.\noptional arguments: -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH length (default: 14) --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export dataframe data to csv,json,xlsx file (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) "},{"id":175,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/line/","title":"Line","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: line [--log] [-d] [--ml ML] [--ms MS] [-h] [--export {png,jpg,pdf,svg}] Show line plot of selected data and allow to draw lines or highlight specific datetimes.\noptional arguments: --log Plot with y on log scale (default: False) -d, --draw Draw lines and annotate on the plot (default: False) --ml ML Draw vertical line markers to highlight certain events (default: ) --ms MS Draw scatter markers to highlight certain events (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) --export {png,jpg,pdf,svg} Export figure into png, jpg, pdf, svg (default: ) "},{"id":176,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/load/","title":"Load","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"Use the load command within the submenu.\n"},{"id":177,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/normality/","title":"Normality","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: normality [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] Normality tests\nTo learn more about this subject, visit the Wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test\nA 2011 study concludes that Shapiro–Wilk has the best power for a given significance, followed closely by Anderson–Darling when comparing the Shapiro–Wilk, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Lilliefors, and Anderson–Darling tests.\noptional arguments: --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export dataframe data to csv,json,xlsx file (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) Example:\n2022 Feb 16, 11:11 (✨) /stocks/qa/ $ normality Normality Statistics ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ ┃ Statistic ┃ p-value ┃ ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩ │ Kurtosis │ 10.2422 │ 0.0000 │ ├────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┤ │ Skewness │ -0.2238 │ 0.8229 │ ├────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┤ │ Jarque-Bera │ 1155.1958 │ 0.0000 │ ├────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┤ │ Shapiro-Wilk │ 0.9265 │ 0.0000 │ ├────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┤ │ Kolmogorov-Smirnov │ 0.4680 │ 0.0000 │ └────────────────────┴───────────┴─────────┘ "},{"id":178,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/om/","title":"Om","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: om [-s START] [-e END] [-h] Provides omega ratio of the selected stock.\nThe omega ratio is the probability weighted ratio of gains versus losses for a threshold return.

See the Wiki page on this topic here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q–Q_plot\nA Q–Q plot is used to compare the shapes of distributions, providing a graphical view of how properties such as location, scale, and skewness are similar or different in the two distributions. Q–Q plots can be used to compare collections of data, or theoretical distributions. The use of Q–Q plots to compare two samples of data can be viewed as a non-parametric approach to comparing their underlying distributions. A Q–Q plot is generally a more powerful approach to do this than the common technique of comparing histograms of the two samples, but requires more skill to interpret. Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model.\nThe points plotted in a Q–Q plot are always non-decreasing when viewed from left to right. If the two distributions being compared are identical, the Q–Q plot follows the 45° line y = x. If the two distributions agree after linearly transforming the values in one of the distributions, then the Q–Q plot follows some line, but not necessarily the line y = x. If the general trend of the Q–Q plot is flatter than the line y = x, the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the vertical axis. Conversely, if the general trend of the Q–Q plot is steeper than the line y = x, the distribution plotted on the vertical axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis. Q–Q plots are often arced, or \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; shaped, indicating that one of the distributions is more skewed than the other, or that one of the distributions has heavier tails than the other.\nAlthough a Q–Q plot is based on quantiles, in a standard Q–Q plot it is not possible to determine which point in the Q–Q plot determines a given quantile. For example, it is not possible to determine the median of either of the two distributions being compared by inspecting the Q–Q plot. Some Q–Q plots indicate the deciles to make determinations such as this possible.\nThe intercept and slope of a linear regression between the quantiles gives a measure of the relative location and relative scale of the samples. If the median of the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is 0, the intercept of a regression line is a measure of location, and the slope is a measure of scale. The distance between medians is another measure of relative location reflected in a Q–Q plot. The \u0026ldquo;probability plot correlation coefficient\u0026rdquo; (PPCC plot) is the correlation coefficient between the paired sample quantiles. The closer the correlation coefficient is to one, the closer the distributions are to being shifted, scaled versions of each other. For distributions with a single shape parameter, the probability plot correlation coefficient plot provides a method for estimating the shape parameter – one simply computes the correlation coefficient for different values of the shape parameter, and uses the one with the best fit, just as if one were comparing distributions of different types.\nAnother common use of Q–Q plots is to compare the distribution of a sample to a theoretical distribution, such as the standard normal distribution N(0,1), as in a normal probability plot. As in the case when comparing two samples of data, one orders the data (formally, computes the order statistics), then plots them against certain quantiles of the theoretical distribution.\noptional arguments: -h, --help show this help message (default: False) "},{"id":181,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/quantile/","title":"Quantile","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: quantile [-l N_LENGTH] [-q F_QUANTILE] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] In statistics and probability, quantiles are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way.\nThe quantiles are values which divide the distribution such that there is a given proportion of observations below the quantile. For example, the median is a quantile. The median is the central value of the distribution, such that half the points are less than or equal to it and half are greater than or equal to it. By default, q is set at 0.5, which effectively is median. Change q to get the desired quantile (0 \u0026lt; q \u0026lt; 1).\nSee the Wiki page on this topic for further explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile\noptional arguments: -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH length (default: 14) -q F_QUANTILE, --quantile F_QUANTILE quantile (default: 0.5) --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export dataframe data to csv,json,xlsx file (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) "},{"id":182,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/raw/","title":"Raw","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: raw [-n NUM] [-d] [-h] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] Shows historical daily value for the target value.\noptional arguments: -n NUM, --num NUM Number to show (default: 20) -d, --descend Sort in descending order (default: False) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export raw data into csv, json, xlsx (default: ) Example:\n2022 Feb 16, 11:05 (✨) /stocks/qa/ $ raw Raw Data ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ ┃ Adjclose ┃ ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━┩ │ 2022-01-19 │ 995.650 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-20 │ 996.270 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-21 │ 943.900 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-24 │ 930.000 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-25 │ 918.400 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-26 │ 937.410 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-27 │ 829.100 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-28 │ 846.350 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-31 │ 936.720 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-01 │ 931.250 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-02 │ 905.660 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-03 │ 891.140 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-04 │ 923.320 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-07 │ 907.340 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-08 │ 922.000 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-09 │ 932.000 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-10 │ 904.550 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-11 │ 860.000 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-14 │ 875.760 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-15 │ 922.430 │ └────────────┴──────────┘ "},{"id":183,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/rolling/","title":"Rolling","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: rolling [-l N_LENGTH] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] Rolling mean and std deviation, To learn more on this topic, visit: https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html\noptional arguments: -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH Window length (default: 14) --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export dataframe data to csv,json,xlsx file (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) "},{"id":184,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/sh/","title":"Sh","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: sh [-r RFR] [-w WINDOW] [-h] Provides the sharpe ratio of the selected stock.\nThe sharpe ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rates from the return and then divide it by the risk, measured by the volatility.

It was created by an anonymous │ │ │ individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code is available │ │ │ publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the │ │ │ developmental process. Bitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. The │ │ │ idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, │ │ │ that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable │ │ │ way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment │ │ │ easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere │ │ │ all the time with no central authority and banks. Bitcoin is designed to have │ │ │ only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency. │ │ │ Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction │ │ │ confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip │ │ │ dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes. │ │ │ Being the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired │ │ │ other alternative currencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, and so on. │ │ │ The cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete │ │ │ smart contract by Ethereum which led to the development of other amazing │ │ │ projects such as EOS, Tron, and even crypto-collectibles such as CryptoKitties. │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Contract Address │ {} │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Market Cap Rank │ 1 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Public Interest Score │ 0.34 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Total Supply │ 21000000.00 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Max Supply │ 21000000.00 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Circulating Supply │ 18958987.00 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Price Change Percentage 24H │ 4.47 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Price Change Percentage 7D │ 0.82 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Price Change Percentage 30D │ 2.41 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Current Price Btc │ 1.00 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Current Price Eth │ 14.27 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Current Price Usd │ 44269 │ └─────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ "},{"id":273,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/cryptocurrency/due_diligence/inv/","title":"Inv","parent":"Due Diligence","content":"usage: inv [-h] [--export EXPORT]\nDisplay asset\u0026rsquo;s investors [Source: https://messari.io]\noptional arguments: -h, --help show this help message (default: False) --export EXPORT Export raw data into csv, json, xlsx (default: ) "},{"id":274,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/cryptocurrency/due_diligence/links/","title":"Links","parent":"Due Diligence","content":"usage: links [-h] [--export EXPORT]\nDisplay asset\u0026rsquo;s links [Source: https://messari.io]\noptional arguments: -h, --help show this help message (default: False) --export EXPORT Export raw data into csv, json, xlsx (default: ) "},{"id":275,"href":"/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/cryptocurrency/due_diligence/market/","title":"Market","parent":"Due Diligence","content":"usage: market [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] Market data for loaded coin.

{csv,json,xlsx,png,jpg,pdf,svg}] Show co-integration between timeseries.\nCointegration is a statistical property of a collection (X1, X2, \u0026hellip;, Xk) of time series variables. First, all of the series must be integrated of order d (see Order of integration). Next, if a linear combination of this collection is integrated of order less than d, then the collection is said to be co-integrated. Formally, if (X,Y,Z) are each integrated of order d, and there exist coefficients a,b,c such that aX + bY + cZ is integrated of order less than d, then X, Y, and Z are cointegrated. Cointegration has become an important property in contemporary time series analysis. Time series often have trends—either deterministic or stochastic. In an influential paper, Charles Nelson and Charles Plosser (1982) provided statistical evidence that many US macroeconomic time series (like GNP, wages, employment, etc.) have stochastic trends.

Ordinarily, regressions reflect \u0026ldquo;mere\u0026rdquo; correlations, but Clive Granger argued that causality in economics could be tested for by measuring the ability to predict the future values of a time series using prior values of another time series. Since the question of \u0026ldquo;true causality\u0026rdquo; is deeply philosophical, and because of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy of assuming that one thing preceding another can be used as a proof of causation, econometricians assert that the Granger test finds only \u0026ldquo;predictive causality\u0026rdquo;. Using the term \u0026ldquo;causality\u0026rdquo; alone is a misnomer, as Granger-causality is better described as \u0026ldquo;precedence\u0026rdquo;, or, as Granger himself later claimed in 1977, \u0026ldquo;temporally related\u0026rdquo;.

risk tolerance and market views. Global investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, need to decide how to allocate their investments across different asset classes and countries. The BL model starts from a neutral position using modern portfolio theory (MPT), and then takes additional input from investors' views to determine how the ultimate asset allocation should deviate from the initial portfolio weights.

Thus, the portfolio weights that maximize decorrelation will also maximize the Diversification Ratio when all assets have equal volatility and maximize the Sharpe ratio when all assets have equal risks and returns.\noptional arguments: -p HISTORIC_PERIOD, --period HISTORIC_PERIOD Period to get yfinance data from.

The Sharpe ratio is one of the most widely used methods for calculating risk-adjusted return. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) states that adding assets to a diversified portfolio that has low correlations can decrease portfolio risk without sacrificing returns. Adding diversification should increase the Sharpe ratio compared to similar portfolios with a lower level of diversification. For this to be true, investors must also accept the assumption that risk is equal to volatility, which is not unreasonable but may be too narrow to be applied to all investments. Post-Modern Portfolio Theory (PMPT) allows to extend the concept of Sharpe ratio to other risk measures like conditional value at risk or conditional drawdown at risk to consider downside risk aversion.\nThe Risk-Adjusted Return Ratio is calculated as follows:\n  Subtract the risk-free rate from the return of the portfolio. The risk-free rate could be a U.S. Treasury rate or yield, such as the one-year or two-year Treasury yield.\n  Divide the result by the selected risk measure of the portfolio’s excess return.\n  The Risk-Adjusted Return Ratio can also help explain whether a portfolio\u0026rsquo;s excess returns are due to smart investment decisions or a result of too much risk.\noptional arguments: -p HISTORIC_PERIOD, --period HISTORIC_PERIOD Period to get yfinance data from.

Their paper was one of the first to demonstrate that stock returns are not well explained by beta. In fact, they observed a negative relationship between returns and volatility.

For example, in the context of financial applications, it is known that portfolios optimized in-sample often underperform the naïve (equal weights) allocation out-of-sample. This instability can be traced back to two sources: (i) noise in the input variables; and (ii) signal structure that magnifies the estimation errors in the input variables.

Risk parity has been criticized as being overly conservative and it is improved by re-introducing the asset expected returns into the model and permitting the portfolio to violate the risk parity condition. The paper by Gambeta \u0026amp; Kwon (source) proposes the incorporation of an explicit target return goal with an intuitive target return approach into a second-order-cone model of a risk parity optimization. When the target return is greater than risk parity return, a violation to risk parity allocations occurs that is controlled using a computational construct to obtain near-risk parity portfolios to retain as much risk parity-like traits as possible. This model is used to demonstrate empirically that higher returns can be achieved than risk parity without the risk contributions deviating dramatically from the risk parity allocations. Furthermore, this study reveals that the relaxed risk parity model exhibits advantageous traits of robustness to expected returns, which should not deter the use of expected returns in risk parity model.\noptional arguments: -p HISTORIC_PERIOD, --period HISTORIC_PERIOD Period to get yfinance data from.

Minimum Variance is efficient if assets have similar returns while Maximum Diversification is efficient if assets have similar Sharpe ratios. However, both methods have the drawback that they can be quite concentrated in a small number of assets. For example, the Minimum Variance portfolio will place disproportionate weight in the lowest volatility asset while the Maximum Diversification portfolio will concentrate in assets with high volatility and low covariance with the market. In fact, these optimizations may result in portfolios that hold just a small fraction of all available assets.\nThere are situations where this may not be preferable. Concentrated portfolios also may not accommodate large amounts of capital without high market impact costs. In addition, concentrated portfolios are more susceptible to mis-estimation of volatilities or correlations.\nThese issues prompted a search for heuristic optimizations that meet similar optimization objectives, but with less concentration. The equal weight and capitalization weighted portfolios are common examples of this, but there are other methods that are compelling under different assumptions.\nRisk parity was developed to remove the uncertainty of estimated returns and to protect against losses associated with portfolio concentration. In essence what this means is that you want to prevent allocation a significant portion to just a couple of assets because Minimum Variance and Maximum Diversification say this is the best allocation.\noptional arguments: -p HISTORIC_PERIOD, --period HISTORIC_PERIOD Period to get yfinance data from.

Discount Brokers typically execute orders through internalizers which are routed through OTC channels, avoiding execution on a public exchange entirely.\nWhile much of the OTC volume here can be classified as retail purchases through discount brokers, it is important to recognize that OTC transactions frequently happen in the form of block trades and exotic options/derivatives products, and many companies listed on the NASDAQ/NYSE also have dual listings on the OTCX market.\nAlternative Trading Systems (ATS) are off-exchange venues operated by firms with proprietary trading desks. This data is reported weekly and includes individual tickers, the weekly share volume, and the weekly number of total trades. The major advantage a broker/dealer/HF/HFT has over an individual investor is the direct access to live data feeds from the unlit order books held off-exchange.\nThe data released to the public as \u0026ldquo;transparency\u0026rdquo; is strategically delayed and does not offer direct accountability for the positions held by individual firms. The many loopholes that exist in reporting obligations create an environment favourable to malicious actors and predatory short sellers. The quality of reported data for public consumption may improve in the near future, however, pushback from proprietary trading firms is likely to delay or degrade any progressions towards fair and transparent markets.\nUse the command \u0026lsquo;dpotc\u0026rsquo; to display a barchart comparing dark pool (ATS) and OTC (Non ATS) volume.

These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“ TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals'actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. We acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: Highlights from the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 included: 31 PART I Item 2 Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 2%, and 3%, respectively. Gross margin increased $5.5 billion or 21% driven by growth across each of our segments. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. More Personal Computing Revenue increased $1.5 billion or 12%. Operating expenses increased $1.2 billion or 11% driven by investments in cloud engineering, Gaming, and commercial sales. INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate was 0% and 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 2%, and 4%, respectively. Cost of revenue increased $2.6 billion or 24% driven by growth in Microsoft Cloud and Gaming. The acquisition has been approved by Nuance’ s shareholders, and we expect it to close by the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 36 PART I Item 2 Intelligent Cloud Revenue increased $4.0 billion or 31%. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties. Key changes in operating expenses were: Operating income increased $4.4 billion or 27% driven by growth across each of our segments. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U. S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U. S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U. S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.

PREDICTION] [-s--similar SIMILAR] [-h] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] A discounted cash flow statement looks to analyze the value of a company. To do this we need to predict the future cash flows and then determine how much those cash flows are worth to us today. We predict the future expected cash flows by prediciting what the financial statements will look like in the future, and then using this to determine the cash the company will have in the future. This cash is paid to share holders.\nWe use linear regression to predict the future financial statements. Once we have our predicted financial statements we need to determine how much the cash flows are worth today. This is done with a discount factor. Our DCF allows users to choose between Fama French and CAPM for the factor. This allows us to calculate the present value of the future cash flows. The present value of all of these cash payments is the companies' value. Dividing this value by the number of shares outstanding allows us to calculate the value of each share in a company [Source: https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/]\noptional arguments: -a, --audit Generates a tie-out for financial statement information pulled from online.

statistical model that uses financial ratios calculated with accounting data of a specific company in order to check if it is likely (high probability) that the reported earnings of the company have been manipulated. A score of -5 to -2.22 indicated a low chance of fraud, a score of -2.22 to -1.78 indicates a moderate change of fraud, and a score above -1.78 indicated a high chance of fraud.[Source: Wikipedia]\nDSRI: Days Sales in Receivables Index gauges whether receivables and revenue are out of balance, a large number is expected to be associated with a higher likelihood that revenues and earnings are overstated.\nGMI: Gross Margin Index shows if gross margins are deteriorating. Research suggests that firms with worsening gross margin are more likely to engage in earnings management, therefore there should be a positive correlation between GMI and probability of earnings management.\nAQI: Asset Quality Index measures the proportion of assets where potential benefit is less certain. A positive relation between AQI and earnings manipulation is expected.\nSGI: Sales Growth Index shows the amount of growth companies are having. Higher growth companies are more likely to commit fraud so there should be a positive relation between SGI and earnings management.\nDEPI: Depreciation Index is the ratio for the rate of depreciation. A DEPI greater than 1 shows that the depreciation rate has slowed and is positively correlated with earnings management.\nSGAI: Sales General and Administrative Expenses Index measures the change in SG\u0026amp;A over sales. There should be a positive relationship between SGAI and earnings management.\nLVGI: Leverage Index represents change in leverage. A LVGI greater than one indicates a lower change of fraud.\nTATA: Total Accruals to Total Assets is a proxy for the extent that cash underlies earnigns. A higher number is associated with a higher likelihood of manipulation.\nZscore:    The Zmijewski Score is a bankruptcy model used to predict a firm\u0026rsquo;s bankruptcy in two years. The ratio uses in the Zmijewski score were determined by probit analysis (think of probit as probability unit). In this case, scores less than .5 represent a higher probability of default. One of the criticisms that Zmijewski made was that other bankruptcy scoring models oversampled distressed firms and favored situations with more complete data.[Source: YCharts]\nMcKee Score:    The McKee Score is a bankruptcy model used to predict a firm\u0026rsquo;s bankruptcy in one year. It looks at a companie\u0026rsquo;s size, profitability, and liquidity to determine the probability. This model is 80% accurate in predicting bankruptcy.

Can also show raw data and provide a graph with predicted underlying asset ending values. The binomial options model calculates how big an up step or down step in the next time period will likely be. Then it creates a tree doing this at each period. The end results of this is a tree with possible asset values at each \u0026ldquo;step\u0026rdquo;. For our calculations we use a day as our \u0026ldquo;step\u0026rdquo; time period. We then take all of the expected values at the finishing date and use this to begin a tree of option values at each step. The ending results is the value of the option today.\nThe up step is calculated by taking e to the power of volatility times the square root of the change in time during the step. This is the percentage we expect the stock to increase if there is an upward movement. The down step is the inverse of the up step. The probability of the up step is calculated by taking e to the power of the risk free rate minus the dividend yield.

This expected profit is divided by one plus the risk free rate to determine the value of those future dollars today. The expected payoff for each strike price is then compared with the last traded price to determine if there are differences in the market.\nFor example, if you assume the price of AAPL has an equal chance of finishing at $100 or $200 for a given expiration, you could use this to value an option at that expiration. To value a call with a strike of $150, you would calculate the payoff for each stock price, which would be $0 and $50. Then, we caclulate the weighted average payoff of $25. We need to divide this amount by the risk-free rate, assumed to be 0.02.

We represent millions of investors who want to leverage state-of-the-art data science and machine learning technologies to make sense of raw unrefined data. Our mission is to make investment research effective, powerful and accessible to everyone.\n If you are new to the terminal, please continue reading this  Getting Started page that explains how the terminal works. To get an understanding of each menu (e.g. stocks or economy) visit the related introduction page.  Why Python?    Python is one of the most used programming languages due to its simplified syntax and shallow learning curve. On top of this, it is highly used in data science and academia world (particularly on finance, economics or business related degrees). This is very important, as it is the first time in history that users - regardless of their background - can so easily add features to an investment research platform.\nThe OpenBB Terminal provides a modern Python-based integrated environment for investment research, that allows an average joe retail trader to leverage state-of-the-art Data Science and Machine Learning technologies. As a modern Python-based environment, the OpenBB Terminal opens access to numerous Python data libraries in Data Science (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Jupyter), Machine Learning (Pytorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Flair), and Data Acquisition (Beautiful Soup, and numerous third-party APIs).\nWhy Open Source?    An open source product allows for higher quality, greater reproducibility, lower costs, more transparency, and faster go-to-market due to the strong community created. In addition, users can adapt the platform to their needs or even build proprietary features on top of our infrastructure - which ultimately can result in a marketplace.\nThe OpenBB Terminal empowers individuals, regardless of whether they want to invest on the stock market in Japan, invest real estate in Portugal or invest in the cryptomarket, to contribute and share their passion, dreams and desires about the OpenBB Terminal. This brings together contributors that are not only software engineers but also financial advisors, data scientists, machine learning researchers, analysts, day traders, mathematicians, academics, physicists and portfolio managers.\nAccessing the OpenBB Terminal    The OpenBB Terminal can be directly installed on your computer via our installation program. Within this section, you are guided through the installation process and how to launch the program. If you are a developer, please have a look here. If you struggle with the installation process, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach us on Discord or visit our contact page.\nInstallation for Windows    The process starts off by downloading the installer, see below for how to download the most recent release:\n Go to the following link Click on the \u0026lsquo;Latest\u0026rsquo; release and scroll down Click on the \u0026ldquo;.exe\u0026rdquo; file, this downloads the installation program  When the file is downloaded, you can follow the following steps:\n   Installation instructions Illustration     Double click the .exe file that got downloaded to your \u0026ldquo;Downloads\u0026rdquo; folder. You will most likely receive the error on the right stating \u0026ldquo;Windows protected your PC\u0026rdquo;. This is because the installer is still in beta phase, and the team has not yet requested verification from Windows.  Click on \u0026ldquo;More info\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026ldquo;Run anyway\u0026rdquo; to start the installation process. Proceed by following the steps. Do note that if you wish to install the application to \u0026lsquo;Program Files\u0026rsquo; that you will have to run the resulting application as Administrator.  By clicking on the application that appeared on your Desktop, you are able to run the Terminal. The first time this takes a bit longer to load. \n\n\n    Installation for macOS    The process starts off by downloading the installer, see below for how to download the most recent release:\n Go to the following link Click on the \u0026lsquo;Latest\u0026rsquo; release and scroll down Click on the \u0026ldquo;.dmg\u0026rdquo; file, this downloads the installation program  Installation instructions:\n Open the .dmg file that got downloaded to your \u0026ldquo;Downloads\u0026rdquo; folder. Drag the folder into your \u0026ldquo;Applications\u0026rdquo; folder. This should take some time as it is extracting the files from the .dmg file. Open the folder and click on the \u0026ldquo;OpenBB Terminal\u0026rdquo; file, this should run the application.  \n   Note about \u0026ldquo;Cannot check it for malicious software\u0026rdquo; warning Illustration     Run the file. You will most likely receive a message that macOS was not able to check whether the application contains malicious software. This is because the installer is still in beta phase, and the team has not yet requested verification from Apple. See below how to correct for this.  Go to System Preferences \u0026gt; Security \u0026amp; Privacy \u0026gt; General. You should see a message at the bottom that says that the file \u0026ldquo;was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer\u0026rdquo;. Click on “Allow anyway” or \u0026ldquo;Open anyway\u0026rdquo;.  You should now be able to launch the application.     Structure of the OpenBB Terminal    The OpenBB Terminal is based off the Command Line Interface (CLI) which is installed by default on every computer. By opening the application you have installed via \u0026ldquo;Accessing the OpenBB Terminal\u0026rdquo;, you are greeted with the following interface:\n\nThe OpenBB Terminal is centered around keyboard input. To navigate and perform analysis you will have to type in the name of the command followed by an ENTER (⏎). If you wish to see information about the OpenBB Terminal you can do so by typing about and then press ENTER (⏎). As you are typing, you will notice that you receive suggestions, by using the DOWN (⌄) arrow and pressing ENTER (⏎) you can select the command and execute it.\nThroughout the entire terminal, the same set of colors are used which all share the same representation. This is structured as follows:\n Light Blue: represents commands. Dark Blue: represents menus, also recognizable by the \u0026gt; in front. Orange: represents titles and headers. Yellow: represents descriptions of a parameter or variable. White: represents text, usually in combination with a description that is in Yellow.  Explanation of Menus    Menus, depicted in Dark Blue, take you to a new section of the terminal referred to as a menu. For example, if you wish to view information about stocks, you can do so by typing stocks and pressing ENTER (⏎). This opens a new menu as depicted below.\n\nDepending on the menu you are in, you are presented with a new set of commands (see \u0026ldquo;Explanation of Commands\u0026rdquo;) and menus you can select. There are interactions in place between each menu. For example, when selecting a company within the stocks menu, the terminal will remember your selection when you visit the fa or options menu. See Introduction to Stocks for more information.\nExplanation of Commands    Commands, depicted in Light Blue, execute an action or task. For example, the commands that you are able to use from any menu in the terminal (see \u0026ldquo;Explanation of Menus\u0026rdquo;) are as follows:\n cls: clears the screen, by executing this command you are left with an empty screen. help, h or ?: displays the menu that you are currently on. quit, q or ..: allows for navigation through the menu. E.g. if you type stocks press ENTER (⏎) and then use q and press ENTER (⏎) you return to where you started. Validate this by typing ? and pressing ENTER (⏎). support: allows you to submit bugs, questions and suggestions.  Continuing with the example mentioned at quit, revisit the stocks menu and look at the commands. At the top you will see a command named load. To understand what this command can do, you can use load -h followed by ENTER (⏎). The -h stands for help and every command will have this feature. This will return the following:\n2022 May 19, 05:27 (🦋) /stocks/ $ load -h usage: load [-t TICKER] [-s START] [-e END] [-i {1,5,15,30,60}] [--source {yf,av,iex,polygon}] [-p] [-f FILEPATH] [-m] [-w] [-r {ytd,1y,2y,5y,6m}] [-h] Load stock ticker to perform analysis on. When the data source is yf (Yahoo Finance), an Indian ticker can be loaded by using '.NS'at the end, e.g. 'SBIN.NS'.

These are additional options you can provide to the command. Each default value is also displayed which is used when you do not select this option. For example, if I would use the stock ticker of Amazon (AMZN, which can also be found with search amazon), I can use load AMZN which will return the following:\n2022 May 19, 05:27 (🦋) /stocks/ $ load AMZN Loading Daily AMZN stock with starting period 2019-05-15 for analysis.

So, if you would visit the ta menu (which stands for Technical Analysis) you will see that, by running any command, the selected period above is depicted again. Return to the Stocks menu again by using q and use it again to return to the home screen which can be shown with ?.\nAccessing other sources of data via API keys    Within this menu you can define your, often free, API key from various platforms like Alpha Vantage, FRED, IEX, Twitter, DeGiro, Binance and Coinglass. API keys are in essence a set of random characters that is unique to you.\nYou can access this menu from the homepage with keys which will open the menu as shown below:\n\nWithin this menu you are able to set your API keys to access the commands that require that key. You can do so by typing the command followed by the API key, for example: fred a215egade08a8d47cfd49c849658a2be. When you press ENTER (⏎) the terminal will test whether this API key works. If it does, you receive the message defined, test passed and if it does not, you receive the message defined, test failed.\nTo figure out where you can obtain the API key, you can enter the command (e.g. av) and press ENTER (⏎) or use the table below. We recommend that you gradually obtain and set keys whenever you wish to use features that require an API key. For example, if you are interested in viewing recent news about a company, you should set the API key from the \u0026lsquo;News API\u0026rsquo;.\n   Command Name URL     av AlphaVantage https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key   fmp Financial Modelling Prep https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/   quandl Quandl https://www.quandl.com   polygon Polygon https://polygon.io   fred Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) https://fred.stlouisfed.org   news News API https://newsapi.org/   tradier Tradier https://developer.tradier.com   cmc CoinMarketCap https://coinmarketcap.com/   finnhub Finnhub https://finnhub.io/   iex IEX Cloud https://iexcloud.io/   reddit Reddit https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api   twitter Twitter https://developer.twitter.com   rh Robinhood https://robinhood.com/us/en/   degiro DeGiro https://www.degiro.com/   oanda Oanda https://developer.oanda.com   binance Binance https://binance.com   bitquery Bitquery https://bitquery.io/   si Sentiment Investor https://sentimentinvestor.com   cb Coinbase https://help.coinbase.com/en/exchange/managing-my-account/how-to-create-an-api-key   walert Whale Alert https://docs.whale-alert.io/   glassnode Glassnode https://docs.glassnode.com/basic-api/api-key#how-to-get-an-api-key/   coinglass Coinglass https://coinglass.github.io/API-Reference/#api-key   ethplorer Ethplorer https://github.com/EverexIO/Ethplorer/wiki/Ethplorer-API   smartstake Smartstake https://www.smartstake.io   github GitHub https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api    Available menus    There is a large collection of (sub) menus available.

To find a detailed description and explanation of its usage for each menu, click on the corresponding link to visit the introduction page.\nThe asset class menus are as follows:\n Introduction to Stocks: access historical pricing data, options, sector and industry analysis, and overall due diligence. Introduction to Crypto: dive into onchain data, tokenomics, circulation supply, nfts and more. Introduction to ETF: explore exchange traded funds, historical pricing, holdings and screeners. Introduction to Forex: see foreign exchanges, quotes, forward rates for currency pairs and Oanda integration. Introduction to Funds: discover mutual funds, general overviews, holdings and sector weights.  The other menus are as follows:\n Introduction to Economy: explore global macroeconomic data including interest and inflation rates, GDP and its components, futures, yield curves and treasury rates. Introduction to Alternative: explore alternative datasets such as COVID and open source metrics. Introduction to Econometrics: perform (advanced) regression techniques and statistical tests on custom datasets to understand relationships for both time series and panel data. Introduction to Portfolio: understand how your portfolio evolved over time, what assets contributed the most to this performance, compare this to a benchmark and make adjustments via various portfolio optimization techniques. Introduction to Dashboards: see interactive dashboards using voila and jupyter notebooks. Introduction to Reports: create customizable research reports through jupyter notebooks.  To adjust the lay-out and settings of the OpenBB Terminal you can access the settings menu. This menu allows you to tweak how the terminal behaves. For example, you are able to define the coloring, interactive graphs and whether to use pretty tables.\nObtaining support and/or giving feedback    Being an open source platform that wishes to tailor to the needs of any type of investor, we highly encourage anyone to share with us their experience and/or how we can further improve the OpenBB Terminal. This can be anything from a very small bug to a new feature to the implementation of a highly advanced Machine Learning model.\nYou are able to directly send us information about a bug or question/suggestion from inside the terminal by using the support command which is available everywhere in the terminal. Here you can select which command you want to report a bug, ask a question or make a suggestion on. When you press ENTER (⏎), you are taken to the Support form which is automatically filled with your input. You are only required to include the type (e.g. bug, suggestion or question) and message in the form although this can also be set directly from inside the terminal (see support -h).\n\nAlternatively, you can contact us via the following routes:\n If you notice that a feature is missing inside the terminal, please fill in the Request a Feature form. If you wish to report a bug, have a question/suggestion or anything else, please fill in the Support form. If you wish to speak to us directly, please contact us via Discord.

It does so by introducing a multitude of optimization techniques ranging from mean-variance optimization to risk parity models and hierarchical clustering models. By providing Excel templates, the user can make sense of the vast array of parameters that each command has. E.g. think of the historic period you wish to use or which of the more than 10 risk measures and covariance methods should be used? These are questions the templates make easier to answer.\nHow to use    The portfolio optimization menu can be reached by visiting the portfolio menu and typing po (or alternatively, typing /portfolio/po from any location). This opens the following menu:\n\nThis menu requires the usage of the Excel templates to work properly. As there is a lot of complexity involved around these techniques, these templates allow the user to understand what values for each parameter are actually used and allow for an easy way to define the allocation.\nFor this there are two templates that need to be set:\n OpenBB Parameters Template: found in the OpenBB Terminal directory within OpenBB Terminal/OpenBB/portfolio/parameters OpenBB Portfolio Template: found in the OpenBB Terminal directory within OpenBB Terminal/OpenBB/portfolio/allocation  If this location does not exist, use this link to download the most recent versions and place the contents inside a folder named portfolio within the OpenBB Terminal/OpenBB directory.\nOpenBB Parameters Template    This template provides the user with the ability to set define values for each parameter based on the optimization technique that is deployed. E.g. if you select riskparity for the technique parameter, you will notice that some parameters turn grey. This means that the parameter is irrelevant for the selected method.\nThe OpenBB Terminal does, however, allow the user to run any model despite the technique you selected. Therefore, if you are interested in running multiple models, consider removing the value for technique. Do note that this makes it more difficult to understand which values are used for which model.\n\nOnce you have defined the parameters, save the template and load it inside the terminal by using the file command. If done correctly, the parameters file should show automatically after typing file and pressing SPACE. Then, by using the DOWN KEY (⌄) you can select the file by pressing ENTER (⏎) which will then be loaded into the terminal:\n2022 May 02, 06:51 (🦋) /portfolio/po/ $ file OpenBB_Parameters_Template v1.0.0.xlsx Parameters: historic_period : 3y log_returns : 0 return_frequency : d max_nan : 0.05 threshold_value : 0.3 nan_fill_method : time risk_free : 0.003 significance_level : 0.05 risk_measure : MV target_return : -1 target_risk : -1 expected_return : hist covariance : hist smoothing_factor_ewma : 0.94 long_allocation : 1 short_allocation : 0 OpenBB Portfolio Template    This template hands the user a format to work with it to define the portfolio. Here, categorization is applied based on asset class, sector, industry, country and currency. By using the dropdown menus within this Excel, you are able to apply the proper categorization. This is based on the same methodology as found in other areas of the terminal.\n\nYou can load in the portfolio template by using the load command:\n2022 Apr 26, 01:35 (🦋) /portfolio/po/ $ load OpenBB_Portfolio_Template_v1.0.0.xlsx 2022 Apr 26, 02:15 (🦋) /portfolio/po/ $ show Current Portfolios: None Current Categories: ASSET_CLASS, SECTOR, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY, CURRENT_INVESTED_AMOUNT, CURRENCY Performing optimization    Based on the parameters and allocation the user has set, the optimization process begins. What optimization technique is ideal depends entirely on the user\u0026rsquo;s risk profile and objectives. As an illustration, Risk Parity is presented below via the riskparity command:\n2022 May 30, 05:47 (🦋) /portfolio/po/ $ riskparity Optimization can take time. Please be patient...

which is one of the most used programming languages due to its simplified syntax and shallow learning curve. It is the first time in history that users - regardless of their background - can so easily add features to an investment research platform.  Open Source and Transparency  The MIT Open Source license allows any user to fork the project to either add features to the broader community or create their own customized terminal version.  Importing and Exporting data  The terminal allows for users to import their own proprietary datasets to use on our econometric menu. In addition, users are allowed to export any type of data to any type of format whether that is raw data in Excel or an image in PNG. This is ideal for finance content creation.   Automatic notebook reports  Create notebook templates (through papermill) which can be run on different tickers. This level of automation allows to speed up the development of your investment thesis and reduce human error.  GST API and Customizable notebook reports  Use our OpenBB Terminal environment to access raw data through a Jupyter notebook and play with it accordingly. Or just create customizable notebook reports for your colleagues and friends doing research on a particular asset or a macro economic event impact on said asset. The possibilities are endless.  Advanced user and routines  Navigate through 500+ terminal features using fast shortcuts and leverage auto-complete functionality. Jump from looking into your portfolio to compare the financials of those companies in a few seconds. Leverage our routines implementation to run analysis while you drink your coffee/tea.     Financial Chatting Bot  Discord, Telegram, Slack and GroupMe integration  The only cross-platform financial chatting bot to accommodate for your already existing groups/chats/servers.  Investment data should be OS agnostic  This bot will allow to access the terminal features using any type of device. From mobile phone to tablet and computer.   Use bot for your own investment research  If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to engage with the bot in an open-server setting, you can message the bot directly and interact with data on a more private setting.  Customize the bot to your needs  The bot also benefits from an MIT Open Source license, which means that you can customize it according to your needs and include proprietary features.
