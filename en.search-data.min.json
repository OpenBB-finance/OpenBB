The indicator consists of two lines (Up and Down) that measure how long it has been since the highest high/lowest low has occurred within an n period range. When the Aroon Up is staying between 70 and 100 then it indicates an upward trend. When the Aroon Down is staying between 70 and 100 then it indicates an downward trend. A strong upward trend is indicated when the Aroon Up is above 70 while the Aroon Down is below 30. Likewise, a strong downward trend is indicated when the Aroon Down is above 70 while the Aroon Up is below 30. Also look for crossovers.

The middle band is a simple moving average (generally 20 periods) of the typical price (TP). The upper and lower bands are F standard deviations (generally 2) above and below the middle band. The bands widen and narrow when the volatility of the price is higher or lower, respectively. Bollinger Bands do not, in themselves, generate buy or sell signals; they are an indicator of overbought or oversold conditions. When the price is near the upper or lower band it indicates that a reversal may be imminent. The middle band becomes a support or resistance level. The upper and lower bands can also be interpreted as price targets. When the price bounces off of the lower band and crosses the middle band, then the upper band becomes the price target.\n/ta bbands ticker: COST ma_mode: wma "},{"id":95,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/bots/discord/ta/cci/","title":"Cci","parent":"Ta","content":"ta cci - Commodity Channel Index\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/cci\nWhen the CCI moves above +100, a new, strong uptrend is beginning, signaling a buy.

Close the position on CCI rising above −100. Use trending indicators or other technical analysis methods to confirm signals indicated by the CCI.\nLook for overbought levels above +100 and oversold levels below -100. These CCI levels can be adjusted depending on the volatility of the security. For example, for a more volatile security you can use +200 and -200.\nNote: CCI is an unbound oscillator, meaning there is no upside or downside limits. This makes interpreting an overbought or oversold condition subjective. When the CCI is overbought the security can continue to move higher. When the CCI is oversold the security can continue lower as well. Use the CCI in conjunction with additional indicators or price analysis when attempting to read overbought or oversold conditions.\nIf underlying prices make a new high or low that isn\u0026rsquo;t confirmed by the CCI, the divergence may signal a price reversal.\nta cci ticker: BB start: 2019-09-30 end: 2022-02-24 "},{"id":96,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/bots/discord/ta/cg/","title":"Cg","parent":"Ta","content":"ta cg - Center of Gravity Indicator\nThe Center of Gravity indicator, in short, is used to anticipate future price movements and to trade on price reversals as soon as they happen.

The Keltner channel uses the average true range (ATR) or volatility, with breaks above or below the top and bottom barriers signaling a continuation. The channels are typically set two Average True Range values above and below the 20-day EMA. The exponential moving average dictates direction and the Average True Range sets channel width. Keltner Channels are a trend following indicator used to identify reversals with channel breakouts and channel direction. Channels can also be used to identify overbought and oversold levels when the trend is flat.\nIn his 1960 book, How to Make Money in Commodities, Chester Keltner introduced the “Ten-Day Moving Average Trading Rule,” which is credited as the original version of Keltner Channels. This original version started with a 10-day SMA of the typical price {(H+L+C)/3)} as the centerline. The 10-day SMA of the High-Low range was added and subtracted to set the upper and lower channel lines. Linda Bradford Raschke introduced the newer version of Keltner Channels in the 1980s. Like Bollinger Bands, this new version used a volatility based indicator, Average True Range (ATR), to set channel width. StockCharts.com uses this newer version of Keltner Channels.\nMiddle Line: 20-day exponential moving average Upper Channel Line: 20-day EMA + (2 x ATR(10)) Lower Channel Line: 20-day EMA - (2 x ATR(10)) /ta kc ticker: BPT ma_mode: zlma "},{"id":103,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/bots/discord/ta/macd/","title":"Macd","parent":"Ta","content":"ta macd - Moving Average Convergence/Divergence Oscillator\nDeveloped by Gerald Appel in the late seventies, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence oscillator (MACD) is one of the simplest and most effective momentum indicators available. The MACD turns two trend-following indicators, moving averages, into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average from the shorter one. As a result, the MACD offers the best of both worlds: trend following and momentum. The MACD fluctuates above and below the zero line as the moving averages converge, cross and diverge. Traders can look for signal line crossovers, centerline crossovers and divergences to generate signals. Because the MACD is unbounded, it is not particularly useful for identifying overbought and oversold levels.\nMACD Line: (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA) Signal Line: 9-day EMA of MACD Line MACD Histogram: MACD Line - Signal Line /ta macd ticker: POTX "},{"id":104,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/bots/discord/ta/obv/","title":"Obv","parent":"Ta","content":"ta obv - On-Balance Volume over a specified period.\nta obv ticker: ARKK start: 2020-01-01 end: 2022-02-24 "},{"id":105,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/bots/discord/ta/recom/","title":"Recom","parent":"Ta","content":"ta recom - Displays text of a given stock\u0026rsquo;s recommendation based on T/A from the Tradingview API.\n/ta recom ticker: RKT "},{"id":106,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/bots/discord/ta/rsi/","title":"Rsi","parent":"Ta","content":"ta rsi - Relative Strength Index\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculates a ratio of the recent upward price movements to the absolute price movement.

Like skewness, kurtosis describes the shape of a probability distribution and there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Different measures of kurtosis may have different interpretations.\nFor research on this topic, visit: https://www.styleadvisor.com/resources/statfacts/kurtosis\nKurtosis identifies where the volatility risk came from in a distribution of returns. Kurtosis improves one’s understanding of volatility risk.\nKurtosis is also known as the fourth moment of the distribution, used in conjunction with mean, standard deviation, and skewness to understand the shape of a distribution of returns. In its base case, kurtosis has a neutral value of 3.0. The calculation is frequently modified by the second term in the equation below, which scales kurtosis so that the baseline, neutral value is 0.0.\noptional arguments: -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH length (default: 14) --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export dataframe data to csv,json,xlsx file (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) "},{"id":168,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/line/","title":"Line","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: line [--log] [-d] [--ml ML] [--ms MS] [-h] [--export {png,jpg,pdf,svg}] Show line plot of selected data and allow to draw lines or highlight specific datetimes.\noptional arguments: --log Plot with y on log scale (default: False) -d, --draw Draw lines and annotate on the plot (default: False) --ml ML Draw vertical line markers to highlight certain events (default: ) --ms MS Draw scatter markers to highlight certain events (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) --export {png,jpg,pdf,svg} Export figure into png, jpg, pdf, svg (default: ) "},{"id":169,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/load/","title":"Load","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"Use the load command within the submenu.\n"},{"id":170,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/normality/","title":"Normality","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: normality [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] Normality tests\nTo learn more about this subject, visit the Wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test\nA 2011 study concludes that Shapiro–Wilk has the best power for a given significance, followed closely by Anderson–Darling when comparing the Shapiro–Wilk, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Lilliefors, and Anderson–Darling tests.\noptional arguments: --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export dataframe data to csv,json,xlsx file (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) Example:\n2022 Feb 16, 11:11 (✨) /stocks/qa/ $ normality Normality Statistics ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ ┃ Statistic ┃ p-value ┃ ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩ │ Kurtosis │ 10.2422 │ 0.0000 │ ├────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┤ │ Skewness │ -0.2238 │ 0.8229 │ ├────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┤ │ Jarque-Bera │ 1155.1958 │ 0.0000 │ ├────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┤ │ Shapiro-Wilk │ 0.9265 │ 0.0000 │ ├────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┤ │ Kolmogorov-Smirnov │ 0.4680 │ 0.0000 │ └────────────────────┴───────────┴─────────┘ "},{"id":171,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/pick/","title":"Pick","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: pick [-t {Open,High,Low,Close,AdjClose,Volume,Returns,LogRet}] [-h] Select a target variable from the available arguments listed.\noptional arguments: -t {Open,High,Low,Close,AdjClose,Volume,Returns,LogRet}, --target {Open,High,Low,Close,AdjClose,Volume,Returns,LogRet} Select variable to analyze (default: None) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) Example:\n2022 Feb 16, 11:12 (✨) /stocks/qa/ $ load tsla Loading Daily TSLA stock with starting period 2019-02-11 for analysis.

See the Wiki page on this topic here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q–Q_plot\nA Q–Q plot is used to compare the shapes of distributions, providing a graphical view of how properties such as location, scale, and skewness are similar or different in the two distributions. Q–Q plots can be used to compare collections of data, or theoretical distributions. The use of Q–Q plots to compare two samples of data can be viewed as a non-parametric approach to comparing their underlying distributions. A Q–Q plot is generally a more powerful approach to do this than the common technique of comparing histograms of the two samples, but requires more skill to interpret. Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model.\nThe points plotted in a Q–Q plot are always non-decreasing when viewed from left to right. If the two distributions being compared are identical, the Q–Q plot follows the 45° line y = x. If the two distributions agree after linearly transforming the values in one of the distributions, then the Q–Q plot follows some line, but not necessarily the line y = x. If the general trend of the Q–Q plot is flatter than the line y = x, the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the vertical axis. Conversely, if the general trend of the Q–Q plot is steeper than the line y = x, the distribution plotted on the vertical axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis. Q–Q plots are often arced, or \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; shaped, indicating that one of the distributions is more skewed than the other, or that one of the distributions has heavier tails than the other.\nAlthough a Q–Q plot is based on quantiles, in a standard Q–Q plot it is not possible to determine which point in the Q–Q plot determines a given quantile. For example, it is not possible to determine the median of either of the two distributions being compared by inspecting the Q–Q plot. Some Q–Q plots indicate the deciles to make determinations such as this possible.\nThe intercept and slope of a linear regression between the quantiles gives a measure of the relative location and relative scale of the samples. If the median of the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is 0, the intercept of a regression line is a measure of location, and the slope is a measure of scale. The distance between medians is another measure of relative location reflected in a Q–Q plot. The \u0026ldquo;probability plot correlation coefficient\u0026rdquo; (PPCC plot) is the correlation coefficient between the paired sample quantiles. The closer the correlation coefficient is to one, the closer the distributions are to being shifted, scaled versions of each other. For distributions with a single shape parameter, the probability plot correlation coefficient plot provides a method for estimating the shape parameter – one simply computes the correlation coefficient for different values of the shape parameter, and uses the one with the best fit, just as if one were comparing distributions of different types.\nAnother common use of Q–Q plots is to compare the distribution of a sample to a theoretical distribution, such as the standard normal distribution N(0,1), as in a normal probability plot. As in the case when comparing two samples of data, one orders the data (formally, computes the order statistics), then plots them against certain quantiles of the theoretical distribution.\noptional arguments: -h, --help show this help message (default: False) "},{"id":173,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/quantile/","title":"Quantile","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: quantile [-l N_LENGTH] [-q F_QUANTILE] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] In statistics and probability, quantiles are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way.\nThe quantiles are values which divide the distribution such that there is a given proportion of observations below the quantile. For example, the median is a quantile. The median is the central value of the distribution, such that half the points are less than or equal to it and half are greater than or equal to it. By default, q is set at 0.5, which effectively is median. Change q to get the desired quantile (0 \u0026lt; q \u0026lt; 1).\nSee the Wiki page on this topic for further explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile\noptional arguments: -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH length (default: 14) -q F_QUANTILE, --quantile F_QUANTILE quantile (default: 0.5) --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export dataframe data to csv,json,xlsx file (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) "},{"id":174,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/raw/","title":"Raw","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: raw [-n NUM] [-d] [-h] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] Shows historical daily value for the target value.\noptional arguments: -n NUM, --num NUM Number to show (default: 20) -d, --descend Sort in descending order (default: False) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export raw data into csv, json, xlsx (default: ) Example:\n2022 Feb 16, 11:05 (✨) /stocks/qa/ $ raw Raw Data ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ ┃ Adjclose ┃ ┡━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━┩ │ 2022-01-19 │ 995.650 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-20 │ 996.270 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-21 │ 943.900 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-24 │ 930.000 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-25 │ 918.400 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-26 │ 937.410 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-27 │ 829.100 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-28 │ 846.350 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-01-31 │ 936.720 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-01 │ 931.250 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-02 │ 905.660 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-03 │ 891.140 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-04 │ 923.320 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-07 │ 907.340 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-08 │ 922.000 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-09 │ 932.000 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-10 │ 904.550 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-11 │ 860.000 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-14 │ 875.760 │ ├────────────┼──────────┤ │ 2022-02-15 │ 922.430 │ └────────────┴──────────┘ "},{"id":175,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/rolling/","title":"Rolling","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: rolling [-l N_LENGTH] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] Rolling mean and std deviation, To learn more on this topic, visit: https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html\noptional arguments: -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH Window length (default: 14) --export {csv,json,xlsx} Export dataframe data to csv,json,xlsx file (default: ) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) "},{"id":176,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/common/quantitative_analysis/skew/","title":"Skew","parent":"Quantitative Analysis","content":"usage: skew [-l N_LENGTH] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] Skewness is a measure of asymmetry or distortion of symmetric distribution.

It was created by an anonymous │ │ │ individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code is available │ │ │ publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the │ │ │ developmental process. Bitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. The │ │ │ idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, │ │ │ that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable │ │ │ way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment │ │ │ easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere │ │ │ all the time with no central authority and banks. Bitcoin is designed to have │ │ │ only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency. │ │ │ Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction │ │ │ confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip │ │ │ dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes. │ │ │ Being the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired │ │ │ other alternative currencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, and so on. │ │ │ The cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete │ │ │ smart contract by Ethereum which led to the development of other amazing │ │ │ projects such as EOS, Tron, and even crypto-collectibles such as CryptoKitties. │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Contract Address │ {} │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Market Cap Rank │ 1 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Public Interest Score │ 0.34 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Total Supply │ 21000000.00 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Max Supply │ 21000000.00 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Circulating Supply │ 18958987.00 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Price Change Percentage 24H │ 4.47 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Price Change Percentage 7D │ 0.82 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Price Change Percentage 30D │ 2.41 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Current Price Btc │ 1.00 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Current Price Eth │ 14.27 │ ├─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │ Current Price Usd │ 44269 │ └─────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ "},{"id":259,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/cryptocurrency/due_diligence/market/","title":"Market","parent":"Due Diligence","content":"usage: market [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] Market data for loaded coin.

{csv,json,xlsx,png,jpg,pdf,svg}] Show co-integration between timeseries\nCointegration is a statistical property of a collection (X1, X2, \u0026hellip;, Xk) of time series variables. First, all of the series must be integrated of order d (see Order of integration). Next, if a linear combination of this collection is integrated of order less than d, then the collection is said to be co-integrated. Formally, if (X,Y,Z) are each integrated of order d, and there exist coefficients a,b,c such that aX + bY + cZ is integrated of order less than d, then X, Y, and Z are cointegrated. Cointegration has become an important property in contemporary time series analysis. Time series often have trends—either deterministic or stochastic. In an influential paper, Charles Nelson and Charles Plosser (1982) provided statistical evidence that many US macroeconomic time series (like GNP, wages, employment, etc.) have stochastic trends.

Ordinarily, regressions reflect \u0026ldquo;mere\u0026rdquo; correlations, but Clive Granger argued that causality in economics could be tested for by measuring the ability to predict the future values of a time series using prior values of another time series. Since the question of \u0026ldquo;true causality\u0026rdquo; is deeply philosophical, and because of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy of assuming that one thing preceding another can be used as a proof of causation, econometricians assert that the Granger test finds only \u0026ldquo;predictive causality\u0026rdquo;. Using the term \u0026ldquo;causality\u0026rdquo; alone is a misnomer, as Granger-causality is better described as \u0026ldquo;precedence\u0026rdquo;, or, as Granger himself later claimed in 1977, \u0026ldquo;temporally related\u0026rdquo;. Rather than testing whether X causes Y, the Granger causality tests whether X forecasts Y.

This is among the lowest levels of put buying seen during the last two years, indicating extreme greed on the part of investors. (Last changed Dec 29 from a Fear rating) Market Volatility: Neutral [Updated Feb 13 at 7:00pm] The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is at 28.33. This is a neutral reading and indicates that market risks appear low.

This spread is higher than what has been typical for the last two years and indicates that investors are risk averse. (Last changed Feb 9 from a Neutral rating) Market Momentum: Fear [Updated Feb 14 at 4:06pm] The McClellan Volume Summation Index measures advancing and declining volume on the NYSE. During the last month, approximately 5.69% more of each day's volume has traded in declining issues than in advancing issues, pushing this indicator towards the lower end of its range for the last two years. (Last changed Feb 4 from an Extreme Fear rating) Stock Price Strength: Extreme Fear [Updated Feb 13 at 7:00pm] Bonds have outperformed stocks by 3.67 percentage points during the last 20 trading days. This is close to the weakest performance for stocks relative to bonds in the past two years and indicates investors are fleeing risky stocks for the safety of bonds. (Last changed Feb 9 from a Fear rating) Stock Price Breadth: Extreme Fear [Updated Feb 14 at 4:00pm] The number of stocks hitting 52-week lows exceeds the number hitting highs and is at the lower end of its range, indicating extreme fear.

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) states that adding assets to a diversified portfolio that has low correlations can decrease portfolio risk without sacrificing returns. Adding diversification should increase the Sharpe ratio compared to similar portfolios with a lower level of diversification. For this to be true, investors must also accept the assumption that risk is equal to volatility, which is not unreasonable but may be too narrow to be applied to all investments.\nThe Sharpe Ratio is calculated as follows:\n  Subtract the risk-free rate from the return of the portfolio. The risk-free rate could be a U.S. Treasury rate or yield, such as the one-year or two-year Treasury yield.\n  Divide the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return. The standard deviation helps to show how much the portfolio\u0026rsquo;s return deviates from the expected return. The standard deviation also sheds light on the portfolio\u0026rsquo;s volatility.\n  The Sharpe ratio can also help explain whether a portfolio\u0026rsquo;s excess returns are due to smart investment decisions or a result of too much risk.\noptional arguments: -p {1d,5d,1mo,3mo,6mo,1y,2y,5y,10y,ytd,max}, --period {1d,5d,1mo,3mo,6mo,1y,2y,5y,10y,ytd,max} period to get yfinance data from (default: 1y) -v VALUE, --value VALUE Amount to allocate to portfolio (default: 1.0) --pie Display a pie chart for weights (default: False) -r RISK_FREE_RATE, --risk-free-rate RISK_FREE_RATE Risk-free rate of borrowing/lending.

is considered to be all orders executed off-exchange and does not fall under the direct oversight of the SEC, ceding disciplinary actions to the discretion of an industry self-regulating organization, FINRA. The ability to circumvent reporting obligations to the SEC is a major motivating factor in the use of Dark Pools. Discount Brokers typically execute orders through internalizers which are routed through OTC channels, avoiding execution on a public exchange entirely.\nWhile much of the OTC volume here can be classified as retail purchases through discount brokers, it is important to recognize that OTC transactions frequently happen in the form of block trades and exotic options/derivatives products, and many companies listed on the NASDAQ/NYSE also have dual listings on the OTCX market.\nAlternative Trading Systems (ATS) are off-exchange venues operated by firms with proprietary trading desks. This data is reported weekly and includes individual tickers, the weekly share volume, and the weekly number of total trades. The major advantage a broker/dealer/HF/HFT has over an individual investor is the direct access to live data feeds from the unlit order books held off-exchange.\nThe data released to the public as \u0026ldquo;transparency\u0026rdquo; is strategically delayed and does not offer direct accountability for the positions held by individual firms. The many loopholes that exist in reporting obligations create an environment favourable to malicious actors and predatory short sellers. The quality of reported data for public consumption may improve in the near future, however, pushback from proprietary trading firms is likely to delay or degrade any progressions towards fair and transparent markets.\nUse the command \u0026lsquo;dpotc\u0026rsquo; to display a barchart comparing dark pool (ATS) and OTC (Non ATS) volume.

These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“ TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals'actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. We acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: Highlights from the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 included: 31 PART I Item 2 Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 2%, and 3%, respectively. Gross margin increased $5.5 billion or 21% driven by growth across each of our segments. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. More Personal Computing Revenue increased $1.5 billion or 12%. Operating expenses increased $1.2 billion or 11% driven by investments in cloud engineering, Gaming, and commercial sales. INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate was 0% and 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%, 2%, and 4%, respectively. Cost of revenue increased $2.6 billion or 24% driven by growth in Microsoft Cloud and Gaming. The acquisition has been approved by Nuance’ s shareholders, and we expect it to close by the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 36 PART I Item 2 Intelligent Cloud Revenue increased $4.0 billion or 31%. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties. Key changes in operating expenses were: Operating income increased $4.4 billion or 27% driven by growth across each of our segments. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U. S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U. S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U. S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.

PREDICTION] [-s--similar SIMILAR] [-h] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] A discounted cash flow statement looks to analyze the value of a company. To do this we need to predict the future cash flows and then determine how much those cash flows are worth to us today. We predict the future expected cash flows by prediciting what the financial statements will look like in the future, and then using this to determine the cash the company will have in the future. This cash is paid to share holders.\nWe use linear regression to predict the future financial statements. Once we have our predicted financial statements we need to determine how much the cash flows are worth today. This is done with a discount factor. Our DCF allows users to choose between Fama French and CAPM for the factor. This allows us to calculate the present value of the future cash flows. The present value of all of these cash payments is the companies' value. Dividing this value by the number of shares outstanding allows us to calculate the value of each share in a company [Source: https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/]\noptional arguments: -a, --audit Generates a tie-out for financial statement information pulled from online.

bankruptcy) Mscore:    The Beneish model is a statistical model that uses financial ratios calculated with accounting data of a specific company in order to check if it is likely (high probability) that the reported earnings of the company have been manipulated. A score of -5 to -2.22 indicated a low chance of fraud, a score of -2.22 to -1.78 indicates a moderate change of fraud, and a score above -1.78 indicated a high chance of fraud.[Source: Wikipedia]\nDSRI: Days Sales in Receivables Index gauges whether receivables and revenue are out of balance, a large number is expected to be associated with a higher likelihood that revenues and earnings are overstated.\nGMI: Gross Margin Index shows if gross margins are deteriorating. Research suggests that firms with worsening gross margin are more likely to engage in earnings management, therefore there should be a positive correlation between GMI and probability of earnings management.\nAQI: Asset Quality Index measures the proportion of assets where potential benefit is less certain. A positive relation between AQI and earnings manipulation is expected.\nSGI: Sales Growth Index shows the amount of growth companies are having. Higher growth companies are more likely to commit fraud so there should be a positive relation between SGI and earnings management.\nDEPI: Depreciation Index is the ratio for the rate of depreciation. A DEPI greater than 1 shows that the depreciation rate has slowed and is positively correlated with earnings management.\nSGAI: Sales General and Administrative Expenses Index measures the change in SG\u0026amp;A over sales. There should be a positive relationship between SGAI and earnings management.\nLVGI: Leverage Index represents change in leverage. A LVGI greater than one indicates a lower change of fraud.\nTATA: Total Accruals to Total Assets is a proxy for the extent that cash underlies earnigns. A higher number is associated with a higher likelihood of manipulation.\nZscore:    The Zmijewski Score is a bankruptcy model used to predict a firm\u0026rsquo;s bankruptcy in two years. The ratio uses in the Zmijewski score were determined by probit analysis (think of probit as probability unit). In this case, scores less than .5 represent a higher probability of default. One of the criticisms that Zmijewski made was that other bankruptcy scoring models oversampled distressed firms and favored situations with more complete data.[Source: YCharts]\nMcKee Score:    The McKee Score is a bankruptcy model used to predict a firm\u0026rsquo;s bankruptcy in one year. It looks at a companie\u0026rsquo;s size, profitability, and liquidity to determine the probability. This model is 80% accurate in predicting bankruptcy.

Can also show raw data and provide a graph with predicted underlying asset ending values. The binomial options model calculates how big an up step or down step in the next time period will likely be. Then it creates a tree doing this at each period. The end results of this is a tree with possible asset values at each \u0026ldquo;step\u0026rdquo;. For our calculations we use a day as our \u0026ldquo;step\u0026rdquo; time period. We then take all of the expected values at the finishing date and use this to begin a tree of option values at each step. The ending results is the value of the option today.\nThe up step is calculated by taking e to the power of volatility times the square root of the change in time during the step. This is the percentage we expect the stock to increase if there is an upward movement. The down step is the inverse of the up step. The probability of the up step is calculated by taking e to the power of the risk free rate minus the dividend yield. This is multiplied by the change in time for the step and then subtracted by the expected downward movement. This number is then divided by the up step subtracted by then down step. The probability of a downward step is just one minus the probability of an upward step.\nFormulas: up_step = e ^ (volatility * (delta_t ^ (1 / 2))) down_step = 1 / up_step\nprob_up = (e ^ ((risk_free - div_yield) * delta_t) - down_step) / (up_step - down_step) prob_down = 1 - prob_up\noptional arguments: -s STRIKE, --strike STRIKE Strike price for option shown (default: 0) -p, --put Value a put instead of a call (default: False) -e, --european Value a European option instead of an American one (default: False) -x, --xlsx Export an excel spreadsheet with binomial pricing data (default: False) --plot Plot expected ending values (default: False) -v VOLATILITY, --volatility VOLATILITY Underlying asset annualized volatility (default: None) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) Example:\n2022 Feb 16, 08:40 (✨) /stocks/options/ $ binom -s 3100 -e --plot AMZN call at $3100.00 expiring on 2022-03-25 is worth $136.85 2022 Feb 16, 08:41 (✨) /stocks/options/ $ binom -s 3500 -p --plot AMZN put at $3500.00 expiring on 2022-03-25 is worth $389.72 "},{"id":614,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/stocks/options/calc/","title":"Calc","parent":"Options","content":"usage: calc [--put] [--sell] [-s STRIKE] [-p PREMIUM] [-m MIN] [-M MAX] [-h] Calculate profit or loss for given option settings.\noptional arguments: --put Flag to calculate put option (default: False) --sell Flag to get profit chart of selling contract (default: False) -s STRIKE, --strike STRIKE Option strike price (default: 10) -p PREMIUM, --premium PREMIUM Premium price (default: 1) -m MIN, --min MIN Min price to look at (default: -1) -M MAX, --max MAX Max price to look at (default: -1) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) Example:\n2022 Feb 16, 08:45 (✨) /stocks/options/ $ calc -s 30 -p 6 -m 1 -M 50 Strike: $30.0 Premium: $6.0 Breakeven price: $36.0 Max profit: Unlimited Max loss: $-600.0 "},{"id":615,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/stocks/options/chains/","title":"Chains","parent":"Options","content":"usage: chains [-c] [-p] [-m MIN_SP] [-M MAX_SP] [-d TO_DISPLAY] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] [-h] Display the option chain for the selected expiration using the variables as described below.\noptional arguments: -c, --calls Flag to show calls only (default: False) -p, --puts Flag to show puts only (default: False) -m MIN_SP, --min MIN_SP minimum strike price to consider.

This expected profit is divided by one plus the risk free rate to determine the value of those future dollars today. The expected payoff for each strike price is then compared with the last traded price to determine if there are differences in the market.\nFor example, if you assume the price of AAPL has an equal chance of finishing at $100 or $200 for a given expiration, you could use this to value an option at that expiration. To value a call with a strike of $150, you would calculate the payoff for each stock price, which would be $0 and $50. Then, we caclulate the weighted average payoff of $25. We need to divide this amount by the risk-free rate, assumed to be 0.02. So the value of this option expiring in one year is 25/1.02, or $24.51.\noptional arguments: -p, --put Show puts instead of calls (default: False) -m MINI, --min MINI Minimum strike price shown (default: None) -M MAXI, --max MAXI Maximum strike price shown (default: None) -r RISK, --risk RISK The risk-free rate to use (default: None) -h, --help show this help message (default: False) Example:\n2022 Feb 16, 09:45 (✨) /stocks/options/pricing/ $ add -p 100 -c 0.5 2022 Feb 16, 09:46 (✨) /stocks/options/pricing/ $ add -p 200 -c 0.5 2022 Feb 16, 09:46 (✨) /stocks/options/pricing/ $ show Estimated price(s) of AAPL at 2022-05-20 ┏━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ Price ┃ Chance ┃ ┡━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━┩ │ 100.00 │ 0.50 │ ├────────┼────────┤ │ 200.00 │ 0.50 │ └────────┴────────┘ 2022 Feb 16, 09:46 (✨) /stocks/options/pricing/ $ rnval Risk Neutral Values ┏━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ Strike ┃ Last Price ┃ Value ┃ Difference ┃ ┡━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━┩ │ 120.00 │ 53.25 │ 39.99 │ 13.26 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 125.00 │ 48.11 │ 37.49 │ 10.62 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 130.00 │ 43.80 │ 34.99 │ 8.81 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 135.00 │ 37.71 │ 32.49 │ 5.22 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 140.00 │ 35.00 │ 29.99 │ 5.01 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 145.00 │ 30.35 │ 27.49 │ 2.86 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 150.00 │ 26.30 │ 24.99 │ 1.31 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 155.00 │ 22.35 │ 22.49 │ -0.14 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 160.00 │ 18.30 │ 19.99 │ -1.69 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 165.00 │ 15.00 │ 17.50 │ -2.50 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 170.00 │ 11.35 │ 15.00 │ -3.65 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 175.00 │ 8.65 │ 12.50 │ -3.85 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 180.00 │ 6.70 │ 10.00 │ -3.30 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 185.00 │ 4.60 │ 7.50 │ -2.90 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 190.00 │ 3.25 │ 5.00 │ -1.75 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 195.00 │ 2.29 │ 2.50 │ -0.21 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 200.00 │ 1.59 │ 0.00 │ 1.59 │ ├────────┼────────────┼───────┼────────────┤ │ 210.00 │ 0.70 │ 0.00 │ 0.70 │ └────────┴────────────┴───────┴────────────┘ "},{"id":637,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/stocks/options/pricing/show/","title":"Show","parent":"Pricing","content":"usage: show [-h] Shows the list of prices and probabilities entered using the add command.\noptional arguments: -h, --help show this help message (default: False) Example:\n2022 Feb 16, 09:45 (✨) /stocks/options/pricing/ $ add -p 100 -c 0.5 2022 Feb 16, 09:46 (✨) /stocks/options/pricing/ $ add -p 200 -c 0.5 2022 Feb 16, 09:46 (✨) /stocks/options/pricing/ $ show Estimated price(s) of AAPL at 2022-05-20 ┏━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓ ┃ Price ┃ Chance ┃ ┡━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━┩ │ 100.00 │ 0.50 │ ├────────┼────────┤ │ 200.00 │ 0.50 │ └────────┴────────┘ "},{"id":638,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/terminal/stocks/options/scr/","title":"Scr","parent":"Options","content":"usage: scr [-p {TSLA_Calls_90Days,Highest_OI,template,TSLA_Poots,SPY_ATM_Poots,Long_FAANGM,high_IV,3DTE_Degenerate,SPY_ATM_Calls,Highest_IV,Highest_Volume}] [-l LIMIT] [-h] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}] Screener filter output from https://ops.syncretism.io/index.html.
