The Accumulation/Distribution Line is interpreted by looking for a divergence in the direction of the indicator relative to price.

A score of -5 to -2.22 indicated a low chance of fraud, a score of -2.22 to -1.78 indicates a moderate change of fraud, and a score above -1.78 indicated a high chance of fraud.[Source: Wikipedia]\nDSRI: Days Sales in Receivables Index gauges whether receivables and revenue are out of balance, a large number is expected to be associated with a higher likelihood that revenues and earnings are overstated.\nGMI: Gross Margin Index shows if gross margins are deteriorating. Research suggests that firms with worsening gross margin are more likely to engage in earnings management, therefore there should be a positive correlation between GMI and probability of earnings management.\nAQI: Asset Quality Index measures the proportion of assets where potential benefit is less certain. A positive relation between AQI and earnings manipulation is expected.\nSGI: Sales Growth Index shows the amount of growth companies are having. Higher growth companies are more likely to commit fraud so there should be a positive relation between SGI and earnings management.\nDEPI: Depreciation Index is the ratio for the rate of depreciation. A DEPI greater than 1 shows that the depreciation rate has slowed and is positively correlated with earnings management.\nSGAI: Sales General and Administrative Expenses Index measures the change in SG\u0026amp;A over sales. There should be a positive relationship between SGAI and earnings management.\nLVGI: Leverage Index represents change in leverage. A LVGI greater than one indicates a lower change of fraud.\nTATA: Total Accruals to Total Assets is a proxy for the extent that cash underlies earnigns. A higher number is associated with a higher likelihood of manipulation.\nZscore:    The Zmijewski Score is a bankruptcy model used to predict a firm\u0026rsquo;s bankruptcy in two years. The ratio uses in the Zmijewski score were determined by probit analysis (think of probit as probability unit). In this case, scores less than .5 represent a higher probability of default. One of the criticisms that Zmijewski made was that other bankruptcy scoring models oversampled distressed firms and favored situations with more complete data.[Source: YCharts]\noptional arguments: -h, --help show this help message "},{"id":295,"href":"/GamestonkTerminal/stocks/fundamental_analysis/hq/","title":"Hq","parent":"Fundamental Analysis","content":"usage: hq [-h] Opens in Google Maps HQ location of the company.
