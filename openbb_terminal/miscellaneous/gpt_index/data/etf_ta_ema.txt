The Exponential Moving Average is a staple of technical analysis and is used in countless technical indicators. In a Simple Moving Average, each value in the time period carries equal weight, and values outside of the time period
are not included in the average. However, the Exponential Moving Average is a cumulative calculation, including all data. Past values have a diminishing contribution to the average, while more recent values have a greater
contribution. This method allows the moving average to be more responsive to changes in the data.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        Window lengths. Multiple values indicated as comma separated values. (default: [20, 50])
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average for an ETF with default window lengths: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average for an ETF with custom window lengths of 30 and 60: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema -l 30,60
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average for an ETF with a specific offset: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema -o 5
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average for an ETF with custom window lengths and a specific offset: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema -l 30,60 -o 5
