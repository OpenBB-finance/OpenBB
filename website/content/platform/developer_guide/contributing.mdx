<HeadTitle title="Contributing - Developer Guide | OpenBB Platform Docs" />

Thank you for taking the time to engage as a contributor. There is no contribution that is too small.
whether it is a spelling error in the documentation, or contributing code and participating in the
standardization of data, we appreciate all of you.

We hope your contributing experience is a good one, and if there's anything we can do to improve, please send us your feedback.
The list below is intended to provide some guidance on what the general expectations are.

1. Use Cases:
   - Ensure that your contributions directly enhance the OpenBB Platform's functionality or extension ecosystem.

2. Documentation:
   - All code contributions should come with relevant documentation, including the purpose of the contribution, how it works, and any changes it makes to existing functionalities.
   - Update any existing documentation if your contribution alters the behavior of the OpenBB Platform.
   - New router functions must have usage [examples](/platform/user_guides/add_command_examples) defined.

3. Code Quality:
   - Your code should adhere strictly to the OpenBB Platform's coding standards and [conventions](architecture_overview).
   - Ensure clarity, maintainability, and proper organization in your code.

4. [Testing](tests):
   - All contributions must be thoroughly tested to avoid introducing bugs to the OpenBB Platform.
   - Contributions should include relevant automated tests (unit and integration), and any new feature should come with its test cases.
   - See the page [here](tests) for details on the testing and QA infrastructure.

5. Performance:
   - Your contributions should be optimized for performance and should not degrade the overall efficiency of the OpenBB Platform.
   - Address any potential bottlenecks and ensure scalability.

6. Collaboration:
   - Engage actively with the OpenBB development team to ensure that your contributions align with the platform's roadmap and standards.
   - Welcome feedback and be open to making revisions based on reviews and suggestions from the community.
