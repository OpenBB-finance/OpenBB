This page outlines configuring the OpenBB Platform with user settings and environment variables.

## User Settings

User preferences are stored locally, `~/.openbb_platform/`, as a JSON file, `user_settings.json`. It is read upon initializing the Python client, or when the Fast API is authorized. If the file does not exist, it will be created on the first run.

| **Preference**        | **Default**                      | **Options**                                                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Notes on Preferences

:::note

- If a `OpenBBUserData` folder in not in the home directory, the application will create one on first run. The user preferences with paths all default to this folder, be it exports, styles or data - this can be changed at any time to suit.
- The `OpenBBUserData` will still be created even if preferences are not pointing to it, this is because the application needs a place to store logs and other artifacts.
- One way to export files or images from the OpenBB Platform is to leverage that functionality from the OpenBB Charting Extension. The `export_directory` preference is the location where the extension will attempt to save CSV and image files.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are defined in a `.env` file. If this file does not exist, create it inside the same folder `user_settings.json` is located.

- `OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE`: enables verbosity while running the program
- `OPENBB_DEVELOP_MODE`: points hub service to .co or .dev
- `OPENBB_AUTO_BUILD`: enables automatic SDK package build on import
- `OPENBB_CHARTING_EXTENSION`: specifies which charting extension to use
- `OPENBB_API_AUTH_EXTENSION`: specifies which authentication extension to use
- `OPENBB_API_AUTH`: enables API authentication for command endpoints
- `OPENBB_API_USERNAME`: sets API username
- `OPENBB_API_PASSWORD`: sets API password

Variables can be defined for current session only.

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE"] = "True"
from openbb import obb
````

### Proxy Networks

An environment variable can be set, in the `.env` file, to direct the Requests library to a specific address and port.

```env
HTTP_PROXY="<ADDRESS>" or HTTPS_PROXY="<ADDRESS>”
```

For example:

```env
HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.10.10:8000"
```
