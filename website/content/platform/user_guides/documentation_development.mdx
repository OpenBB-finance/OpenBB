The documentation and packages are kept in the `/website` folder, at the base of the repository. Navigate there to install the dependencies and start the development server.

### Generate Markdown Files

Markdown files for the Reference and Data Models pages need to be generated.
This will generate content based on what is actually installed and contained locally, so it may appear different than what is on this website.

Open a terminal command line to the `/OpenBBTerminal/website` folder, then enter:

```bash
python generate_platform_v4_markdown.py
```

### Node.js

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16.13.0
  To check if Node.js installed, run this command:

```bash
node --version # should be v16.13.0 or higher
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

This starts a local development server at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

#### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

OpenBB uses Github Pages to host our website, it's deployed in the `gh-pages` branch.
