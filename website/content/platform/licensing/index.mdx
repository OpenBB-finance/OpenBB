As we adopt the Affero General Public License (AGPL) for our OpenBB Platform, we understand you may have questions about how this change affects your use of the platform. Below are some frequently asked questions to help clarify the implications of our new licensing model.

## General Questions

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: What has changed with the OpenBB Platform license?</summary>

A: We have transitioned from the MIT license to the Affero General Public License (AGPL) with an option for a commercial license. This change aligns with our commitment to keeping OpenBB Platform open and free while also providing options for commercial use.

</details>

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: Why did OpenBB choose AGPL?</summary>

A: AGPL helps ensure that improvements to the OpenBB Platform remain freely available. This license is ideal for protecting the community's contributions while allowing the platform to evolve sustainably.

</details>

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: What does the change to AGPL mean for general users of OpenBB?</summary>

A: For most users, there will be no impact. You can continue to use OpenBB Platform for research, development, and in your applications under the same conditions as before, provided you comply with the AGPL if you distribute the software or run it on a network server.

</details>

## Specific Use Cases

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: I'm using OpenBB Platform for research at work. Do I need a commercial license now?</summary>

A: No, if you are using OpenBB Platform in its unmodified form for research or internal business purposes and do not redistribute it or use it to provide a network-based service, you do not need a commercial license.

</details>

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: I am selling educational content and use OpenBB Platform in my course notebooks. Do I need a commercial license? Do I need to make my course content public?</summary>

A: No, you do not need a commercial license simply for using OpenBB Platform in educational content, nor do you need to make your course content public. If you are using OpenBB Platform to fetch data or perform analysis in your teaching materials, this is considered normal use of the platform. Your educational content is a separate work and does not fall under the AGPL's requirements for derivative works.

</details>

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: I want to integrate a proprietary dataset for internal use through OpenBB Platform. What does this mean for me?</summary>

A: You can freely integrate proprietary datasets without violating the AGPL, provided that any such integration uses standard interfaces of OpenBB Platform and does not modify the core AGPL-licensed code.

</details>

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: I run a business that integrates proprietary datasets through OpenBB Platform for internal use. What does the license change mean for us?</summary>

A: If you are integrating proprietary datasets and creating extensions that do not modify the OpenBB Platform code, these extensions are considered separate works. You do not need to disclose these proprietary integrations under the AGPL, provided these do not form part of the OpenBB Platform distributed to others or used to provide a network-based service.

</details>

## Modifications and Contributions

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: If I modify the OpenBB Platform for personal or internal business use, do I need to disclose my modifications?</summary>

A: If you modify the OpenBB Platform and do not distribute your modified version or use it to provide a service over a network, you do not need to disclose your modifications. However, if you distribute the modified platform or run it as a service, you must share your modifications under the AGPL.

</details>

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: We want to contribute to the OpenBB project. How does the licensing affect our contributions?</summary>

A: This doesn’t change. Contributions to the OpenBB project are very welcome. Contributions to the [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) are accepted under our existing [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal). This means any contributions that are accepted into the main repository will be re-licensed by us under the AGPL, ensuring they remain free and open.

</details>

## Commercial Licensing Options

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Q: What are the benefits of obtaining a commercial license?</summary>

A: A commercial license is suitable for companies that wish to use OpenBB Platform in a proprietary product or service, or who do not wish to disclose their modifications to the platform. It offers more flexibility for commercial use while protecting your proprietary developments.
