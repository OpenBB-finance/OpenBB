<HeadTitle title="Basic Response - Usage | OpenBB Platform Docs" />

The output of every command is an object which contains the results of the request, along with additional information. It is a custom class, `OBBject`, and always returns with the fields listed below:

```console
id: ...                 # UUID Tag
results: ...            # Serializable results.
provider: ...           # Provider name.
warnings: ...           # List of warnings.
chart: ...              # Chart object.
extra: ...              # Extra info.
```

```python
from openbb import obb

data = obb.equity.price.historical("SPY", provider="polygon")

data
```

```console
OBBject

id: 06520558-d54a-7e53-8000-7aafc8a42694
results: [{'date': datetime.datetime(2022, 10, 5, 0, 0), 'open': 375.62, 'high': 37...
provider: polygon
warnings: None
chart: None
extra: {'metadata': {'arguments': {'provider_choices': {'provider': 'polygon'}, 'st...
```

Additional class methods are helpers for converting the results to a variety of formats.

- `to_dict()`: converts to a dictionary, accepting all standard "orientation" parameters, i.e., "records"
- `to_df()` / `to_dataframe()`: converts to a Pandas DataFrame.
- `to_numpy()`: converts to a Numpy array.
- `to_polars()`: converts to a Polars table.

The output from the Fast API is a serialized version of this object, and these methods are lost on conversion. OBBject can be reconstructed to recover the helpers by importing the model and validating the data.

```python
import requests
from openbb_core.app.model.obbject import OBBject

data = []
symbol="SPY"
url = f"http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/equity/price/historical?provider=polygon&symbol={symbol}"
headers = {"accept": "application/json"}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=3)

if response.status_code == 200:
  data = OBBject.model_validate(response.json())

data.to_df()
```

:::info
The preferred output type can be set with a user preference.

```python
obb.user.preferences.output_type="dataframe"
```

## Commands and Provider Coverage

The installed commands and data providers are found under, `obb.coverage`.

```python
obb.coverage
```

```console
/coverage

    providers
    commands
    command_model
    command_schemas
```

`obb.coverage.providers` is a dictionary of the installed provider extensions, each with its own list of available commands.

`obb.coverage.commands` is a dictionary of commands, each with its own list of available providers for the data.

`obb.coverage.command_model` is a dictionary where the keys are the command paths and the values is a nested dictionary of QueryParams and Data models associated with that function.
