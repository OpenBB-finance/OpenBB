This page provides a tutorial for getting started using the `obb.economy.indicators` endpoint, with the `openbb-econdb` provider extension.
The command provides access to over 100 standardized indicator symbols, covering countries around the world.

:::note
**OpenBB is not affiliated with EconDB. All service is provided "AS IS" and without warranty.**

## Authorization

This command requires an API key. You can create an account [here](https://econdb.com), and enter the key assigned.

Leaving the key as None will attempt to retrieve a temporary token that is assigned when downloading the data as a CSV file from a browser.
This is a workaround and can be blocked by Cloudflare. In this instance, the temporary token can be viewed by opening any indicator in your browser,
then selecting 'Python' from the 'Export' drop-down.

![Temporary Token](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/assets/85772166/d2d4c6a7-e8b1-4345-b28f-0693ddb8dcf1)

The best method is to support the service by registering an account.

```python
from openbb import obb
obb.user.credentials.econdb_api_key = REPLACE_WITH_KEY
```

See the [API keys](api_keys) page for more information on credentials.

## Important Considerations

**Carefully inspect data before conducting analysis and arriving at conclusions.**

EconDB sources data directly from national agencies, or other reputable sources such as the IMF, but the data itself may not be directly comparable between collections of countries. For example, some countries will have GDP data as 'annualized' (North America) while others report the values for the period.

These factors can be considered as "known-unknowns", the metadata will not contain this information.

:::important
- This function will not attempt to normalize the values for cross-country comparison. Some values should be manually adjusted, post-request, to accommodate.

- Transforming levels as USD, or % of GDP, may have unexpected results where values are not appropriate for this conversion. Do not attempt to apply these transformations universally.

- Values that are scaled to, or transformed as, a percent are returned as a normalized value - i.e, 1% = 0.01. It will have a multiplier value of 1, which is not indicative of display values.

- Contextual information is contained within metadata, returned under the "extra" attribute of the function response.

## Available Indicators

EconDB has a list of "main" indicators, which are standardized base symbols across the available countries for each.

```python
from openbb import obb

indicators = obb.economy.available_indicators(provider="econdb").to_df()

indicators.iloc[0]
```

Metadata is returned in the command response to the 'extra' attribute.

```python
data = obb.economy.indicators("POLIR", country="EA")
data.extra["results_metadata"]
```

```python

## Countries


<details>

The `country` parameter will accept the ISO country code, or the country name. Regional groups listed below are also valid:

- all
- africa
- central_asia
- east_asia
- europe
- g7
- g20
- latin_america
- middle_east
- north_america
- oceania
- south_asia
- southeast_asia

:::note
Some symbols do not have a country - e.g., commodity items - and they will ignore any supplied values to the parameter.
Not every indicator has data for every country. Items with no results will be communicated via the `warnings` attribute of the response object.

```python
obb.economy.indicators("POLIR", country="southeast_asia")
```
```console
OBBject

id: 0661ac07-ab9c-7ebf-8000-849fef1202bc
results: [{'date': datetime.date(2013, 4, 29), 'symbol': 'POLIRSG', 'country': 'Sin...
provider: econdb
warnings: [{'category': 'UserWarning', 'message': "Invalid country code for...
chart: None
extra: {'results_metadata': {'POLIRID': {'title': 'Indonesia - Policy rate - short ...
```

:::

### Countries By Indicator

In addition to filtering the `available_indicators` data locally, countries by indicator can be imported as a utility function from the `openbb_econdb.utils.helpers` module.

```python
from openbb_econdb.utils.helpers import get_indicator_countries

get_indicator_countries("GDPPC")  # returns a list of two-letter ISO country codes
```
</details>


## How To Enter Symbols

<details>

The three parameters - symbol, country, transform - all work together.

- Symbol (base symbol)
  - CPI, GDP, CORE, etc
  - Multiple items allowed
- Country
  - ISO country code, or name
  - Multiple items allowed
- Transform
  - `tpop`: Percent change from previous period
  - `toya`: Percent change from year ago
  - `tusd`: Values as US dollars
  - `tpgp`: Values as a percent of GDP

The `transform` will apply to all combinations of `symbol` and `country`.

:::warning
If you attempt to pass a base symbol (excluding commodity and world indicators) with no country, it will raise an error.

## Advanced Symbols

<details>

The grouping behaviour can be overridden. This will allow multiple transformations, or for a specific symbol to ignore the supplied `country` and `transform` parameters.

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Example - Bypass Group Parameters</summary>

The "~" character is used to separate the base symbol + 2-letter ISO country code, and the transformation.
It works as a flag to exclude from the other parameters.

```python
obb.economy.indicators("CPIUS~").to_df().tail(2)
```

| date       | symbol_root   | symbol   | country       |   value |
|:-----------|:--------------|:---------|:--------------|--------:|
| 2024-02-01 | CPI           | CPIUS    | United States |   311.1 |
| 2024-03-01 | CPI           | CPIUS    | United States |   312.2 |

Without "~", symbols are assumed to be a base symbol, and require a country parameter. An error (or warning where at least one symbol supplied was valid) is raised if the condition is not met.

```python
obb.economy.indicators("CPIUS")
```

```console
OpenBBError: No valid combination of indicator symbols and countries were supplied.
Valid countries for 'CPIUS' are: None
If the symbol - CPIUS - is missing a country code. Please add the two-letter country code or use the country parameter.
If already included, add '~' to the end of the symbol.
```

This example bypasses the transformation for US data, applying it only to France.

```python
obb.economy.indicators(symbol=["CPIUS~","CPI"], country="fr", transform="toya").to_df().tail(2)
```

| date       | symbol_root   | symbol     | country       |      value |
|:-----------|:--------------|:-----------|:--------------|-----------:|
| 2024-03-01 | CPI           | CPIFR~TOYA | France        |   0.022947 |
| 2024-03-01 | CPI           | CPIUS      | United States | 312.2      |

</details>

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Example - Non-Standard Symbols</summary>

The `symbol` parameter can also be used to access non-standard series. These are specific to reporting entities, like the Ministry of Finance, Japan.
These symbols are not searchable, but the structure will be familiar if you have worked with the particular source before.
For this purpose, enter each symbol ending with, "~".

:::important
Non-standard symbols will not have transformations, standardized metadata, or normalized percent values.
