- **WHY FREE?**

We believe that everyone should be able to have the same tooling to do investment research. By leveraging free API tiers, we can allow users to have access to a vast range of information for free. On the other hand, we want users that are willing to subscribe to premium API keys from certain data providers to be able to take advantage of that on OpenBB Terminal - this is where we see a monetization opportunity, a revenue share with data providers for connecting our users to their resources.

- **WHY OPEN SOURCE?**

An open source product allows for higher quality, lower costs, more transparency, and faster go-to-market due to the strong community created. There is no point in re-inventing the wheel for financial theory that has been around for decades, thus users can adapt the platform to their needs or even build proprietary features on top of our infrastructure.


- **WHY PYTHON?**

Python is one of the most used programming languages due to its simplified syntax and shallow learning curve. On top of this, it is highly used in data science and academia world (particularly on finance, economics or business related degrees). This is very important, as it is the first time in history that users - regardless of their background - can so easily add features to an investment research platform.
