excerpt: "An Introduction to the Behavioural Analysis menu, within the Stocks menu."
---

The Behavioural Analysis menu offers the user tools for gauging the overall public sentiment of a company online. The complexity of the tools range from message board scrapers to deep learning algorithms for financial analysis and prediction. Sentiment is particularly useful for momentum trading strategies, discovery, and general fundamental research. Navigate into the menu from the <a href="/terminal/guides/intros/stocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stocks</a> menu by entering, `ba`; or, using absolute paths from anywhere in the Terminal: `/stocks/ba`

### How to use

The commands with text, representing <a href="https://docs.openbb.co/terminal/guides/basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commands</a>, do not require a ticker, faded commands will turn light blue when there is a ticker loaded.

```
(🦋) /stocks/ba/ $ load gme

Some data sources will require a valid API key, which can be obtained for free and then set using the Keys menu. To use all the features in this menu, obtain free API keys from these providers:

- <a href="https://finnhub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Finnhub</a><br/>
- <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a><br/>
- <a href="https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a><br/>
- <a href="https://sentimentinvestor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sentiment
  Investor</a><br/>

See the <a href="/terminal/guides/advanced/api-keys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Set API keys</a> for help with API keys in the Terminal.

### Examples

As with every command, using the `-h` argument displays the help dialogue. Running the <a href="/terminal/reference/stocks/ba/headlines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headlines</a> command returns the following:

```
(🦋) /stocks/ba/ $ headlines
```

<img alt="headlines" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46355364/170244924-ffe6cd15-8d17-4690-bf44-d2b496dbc310.png"></img>

Alternatively, running the <a href="/terminal/reference/stocks/ba/snews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snews</a> command returns the following:

```
(🦋) /stocks/ba/ $ snews
```

The Reddit functions will return popular tickers and posts, or measure sentiment for a particular stock. An example would be by looking at the threads that pop up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">/r/wallstreetbets</a>, famous for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/wallstreetbets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop short squeeze</a>:
