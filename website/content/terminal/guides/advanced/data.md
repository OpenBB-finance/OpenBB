The `OpenBBUserData` folder's default location is the home of the system user account. By default this will be the following paths:
- macOS: `Macintosh HD/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/OpenBBUserData`
- Windows: `C:/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/OpenBBUserData`

Within the folder you can find files that you have exported as well as files that you wish to import directly into the OpenBB Terminal. For example, this could be an orderbook which you can store in `OpenBBUserData/portfolio/holdings`.

This folder contains all things user-created. For example:

 - Screener presets
 - Portfolio files
 - Exported files
 - Files to be imported by various functions
 - Styles and themes
 - Preferred data sources

 The location of this folder can be set by the user from the `/settings` menu.
