# Folders

On the sidebar, users have a plus icon where they are able to create a new dashboard or folder.

This allows the creation of a new dashboard to perform investment research, or creating a folder to organize multiple dashboards.

Below is an example of a folder that contains multiple dashboards.

A dashboard can be moved into a folder through the dashboard settings with the "Move to", or by dragging the dashboard into the folder.
