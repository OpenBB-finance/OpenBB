# Integrating Third-party Data Providers

OpenBB Terminal Pro allows seamless integration with two types of third-party data providers.

## API Key Connections

To access certain data providers and their associated widgets, you'll need an API key obtained directly from the data provider. We provide step-by-step instructions for each use case to guide you through this process.

## Data Warehouse/Database Connections

For a more robust integration, OpenBB Terminal Pro offers connections to your data warehouse or database. Simply use your login credentials to access your warehouse or database, and swiftly run SQL queries. The queried data can then be rendered as a table within the Terminal Pro interface, providing you with a powerful tool for data analysis.
