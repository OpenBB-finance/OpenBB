## Charting

Our most popular commands center around the real-time charting capabilities we offer with OpenBB Bot. We allow you to customize many different aspects of your charts when you register with us. You can customize the chart theme and style as well as adding any on and off chart indicators you desire. These settings will apply across all platforms.

## Alerts

Alerts are a powerful tool used by OpenBB users. Simply set the symbol and price you wish to be alerted at and we do the rest!

OpenBB Watchlist is a great way to keep track of all your investments in once place. Add Crypto or Stock symbols and quickly see the prices at a glance when its convenient for you.
You can add your tickers through the [HUB](https://my.openbb.co/app/bot/watchlist) or run ```/watchlist``` in your respective platform to configure.
