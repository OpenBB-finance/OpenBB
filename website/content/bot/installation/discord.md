After clicking on the "Add bot to Discord" button, a pop-up window will open, asking you to log in to your Discord account and allow the bot access.

Once you log in, you’ll see a window asking for permission to access your account. Locate the “Add to Server” drop-down menu and click on it.

This will open a list of Discord servers where you can add a bot. Select your server and press “Continue”.

Review permissions that the bot requests on your server. Select and deselect based on your needs, we recommend all the default settings in order to experience everything the bot has to offer. Click on “Authorize” when you’re ready.
